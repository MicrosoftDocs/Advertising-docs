# Get Started Using Java with Bing Ads API
To get started developing Bing Ads API applications with Java, you can start with the [provided examples](code-examples.md) or follow one of the application walkthroughs for a [Web](walkthrough-web-application-java.md) or [Desktop](walkthrough-desktop-application-java.md) application. 

You will need user credentials with access to Microsoft Advertising either in [production](https://secure.ads.microsoft.com/) or [sandbox](https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Auth?EnvContext=Sandbox). For the production environment you will need a [production developer token](get-started.md#get-developer-token). All sandbox clients can use the universal sandbox developer token i.e., **BBD37VB98**. For more information, please see [Get Started With the Bing Ads API](get-started.md) and [Sandbox](sandbox.md).

To authenticate via OAuth, you must also register an application and get the corresponding client identifier. You also need to take note of the client secret and redirect URI if you are developing a web application. For more details about registering an application and the authorization code grant flow, see [Authentication with OAuth](authentication-oauth.md) and [Authentication With the SDKs](sdk-authentication.md#oauth). 

## <a name="installation"></a>Install the SDK
The Bing Ads Java [SDK](client-libraries.md) depends on the libraries listed at the [Maven Repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.bingads/microsoft.bingads/).

When you create a Maven project and include the *microsoft.bingads* Maven artifact as shown below, additional dependencies are installed automatically. If you are not using a Maven project, you must include the correct version of each dependency. For more information, please see the [Walkthrough: Bing Ads API Web Application in Java](walkthrough-web-application-java.md) or [Walkthrough: Bing Ads API Desktop Application in Java](walkthrough-desktop-application-java.md) application examples.

## <a name="walkthrough"></a>Walkthroughs
Once you have the Bing Ads Java [SDK](client-libraries.md) installed, you can either browse the [Bing Ads API Code Examples](code-examples.md), download the examples from [GitHub](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Java-SDK/tree/master/examples), or follow one of the application walkthroughs for a [Web](walkthrough-web-application-java.md) or [Desktop](walkthrough-desktop-application-java.md) application.
