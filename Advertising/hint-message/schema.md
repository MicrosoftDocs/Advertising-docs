# Hint message schema

The Hint XSD defines the schema used by Bing Hotel API's Hint message. The schema defines the objects that you use to specify the hotels whose itinerary information has changed since the last time Microsoft received a successful response from you. For information about the objects and elements that define a Hint message, see [Hint Message Reference](../hint-message/reference.md).

The following is the XSD that defines hint messages.

- [hint.xsd](https://bhacstatic.blob.core.windows.net/schemas/hint.xsd)

Use this XSD to validate your message before sending it to Bing. For information, see [Validating your Hint Message](../hint-message/validate-hint-message.md).

For information about creating hint messages, see [Creating a Hint Message](../hint-message/create-hint-message.md).
