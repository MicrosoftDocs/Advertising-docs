If you create hotel ads in Bing, you must use a points of sale feed to provide Bing information about the sites that users use to book rooms. You must define and import your points of sale feed prior to sending Bing [Transaction Messages](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md).

To provide Bing your points of sale, create an XML document that contains the list of sites that users use to book rooms. A point of sale describes its name, matching criteria, and URL. For information about creating the XML document, see the following topics.
