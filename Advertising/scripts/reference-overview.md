# Microsoft Advertising Scripts Reference

[!INCLUDE[preview-note](./includes/preview-note.md)]

Microsoft Advertising Scripts lets you access and manage your advertising data using JavaScript in a browser-based [script editor](./get-started.md).

This section provides information about the JavaScript objects that you use in your scripts.

For information about Microsoft Advertising entities and the limits that apply to each entity, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](/advertising/guides/entity-hierarchy-limits).
