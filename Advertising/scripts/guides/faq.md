# FAQ

## Why are my scripts being paused?

If your script generates too many failures, the service automatically disables it. Email is sent to notify you that the script was disabled. You can view disabled scripts in the UX by selecting **All scripts** (the dropdown list next to **Create script** contains **All but disabled scripts** and **All scripts**). Disabled scripts have a red dash (-) in the left column. 

Before enabling the script and running it again, you must fix the script errors; otherwise, the service will continue disabling it.
