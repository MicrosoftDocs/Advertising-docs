# Microsoft Advertising Scripts Overview

Want to quickly and easily integrate with Microsoft Advertising without the need for a significant up front financial investment? Want to automate common data workflow interactions and manage repetitive tasks more easily? Then try out Microsoft Advertising Scripts. It lets you access and manage your Microsoft Advertising data using JavaScript in Microsoft Advertising's browser-based script editor.

For information about accessing Scripts in the Microsoft Advertising web application, see [How can I automate my campaigns with Microsoft Advertising Scripts?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56890/-1)

This document assumes you're familiar with Microsoft Advertising and JavaScript. For a Microsoft Advertising refresher, please see:

- [Bing Ads API Overview](/advertising/guides/index)
- [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](/advertising/guides/entity-hierarchy-limits) 
- [Account Hierarchy and User Permissions](/advertising/guides/account-hierarchy-permissions)

Scripts simply provides another surface for working with your Microsoft Advertising data. For example, the same rules about [data freshness](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/54480/2-500) and [time zones](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/54483/2-500) that apply to the Microsoft Advertising's web application and API also apply to Scripts.
