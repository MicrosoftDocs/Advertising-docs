## <a name="getstats"></a>getStats
Gets the performance data for for campaigns that share this budget. 

Performance data is available for shared budgets only. To call this method, you must have called the budget selector's [forDateRange(String dateRange)](BudgetSelector.md#fordaterange-string-daterange-) or [forDateRange(Object dateFrom, Object dateTo)](BudgetSelector.md#fordaterange-object-datefrom-object-dateto-) method. 

### Returns:
|Type|Description|
|-|-
[Stats](Stats.md)|The performance data for campaigns that share this budget. Returns null if the budget is not a shared budget.


## <a name="isexplicitlyshared"></a>isExplicitlyShared
Gets a Boolean value that indicates whether this budget is a shared budget.

The campaigns and the budget they share must be in the same account. Sharing a budget can help fully utilize the budget. For example, if campaign A had its own $10 budget and campaign B had its own $10 budget, it's possible that campaign A may spend only $8 of its budget. But because campaign B is performing well, it spent all of its budget and could have spent more. If the campaigns shared a budget, campaign B would automatically use the $2 that campaign A didn't use, increasing the chance that more traffic is sent your way.

### Returns:
|Type|Description|
|-|-
Boolean|Is **true** if the budget is meant to be shared by multiple campaigns; otherwise, **false**.


## <a name="setamount-double-amount-"></a>setAmount(double amount)
Sets the budget's amount.

To update a shared budget, you must get the budget using [BudgetSelector](./BudgetSelector.md) and [BudgetIterator](./BudgetIterator.md). Setting the budget's amount fails if you get the budget using the [Campaign](./Campaign.md) entity's `getBudget` method.
