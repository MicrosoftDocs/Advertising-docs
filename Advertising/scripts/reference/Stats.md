# Stats

Contains the methods for accessing an entity's performance data.

To get performance data for an entity such as a [campaign](Campaign.md) or [keyword](Keyword.md), call the entity's `getStats` method. But you can only call `getStats` if the [selector](../concepts/selectors.md) that you used to get the entity includes one of the `forDateRange` methods in its chain.

The following [campaign selector](CampaignSelector.md) uses the version of `forDateRange` that uses predefined date ranges like LAST_WEEK or LAST_MONTH. The other version lets you specify the data range using specific dates.


Example usage:
```javascript
    var campaign = AdsApp.campaigns()
        .forDateRange("LAST_WEEK")
        .get()
        .next();
    var stats = campaign.getStats();
    var conversionRate = stats.getConversionRate();
    var convertedClicks = stats.getConversions();
    // etc.
```
