# KeywordOperation

Contains the methods for determining whether the keyword was successfully added. For information about builders, operation objects, and performance considerations, see [What are builders?](../concepts/builders.md)

Because calling any of this object's methods forces Scripts to flush the build queue, be sure to read the performance considerations carefully.
