# UrlFetchApp

This is the top-level object used to fetch resources from the web.

<!--
This example throws 403 now. They've updated the service and now require a 
token. See https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/. They also require attribution, so
we need to find another endpoint to use.

Example usage:
```javascript
function main() {
    // Simple GET request to fetch a stock quote.
    var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch('https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/msft/quote');
    var stock = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
    Logger.log(`stock symbol: ${stock["symbol"]}`);
    Logger.log(`company: ${stock["companyName"]}`);
    Logger.log(`close price: ${stock["close"]}`);
    Logger.log("\nstatus code: " + response.getResponseCode());
}
```
