# Logger

Contains the methods for writing text messages to the console log.

## Methods
|Method Name|Return Type|Description|
|-|-|-
[log(string message)](#log-string-message-)|void|Writes a text string to the log.

## <a name="log-string-message-"></a>log(string message)
Writes a text string to the log. 

If the script is run in live mode, the log is found on the main Scripts page. If the script is run in preview mode, the log is found in the preview pane.

Because logging is an expensive call in terms of performance, guidance is to use logging sparingly and probably not within high volume loops except to provide notification of issues. Also, instead of using multiple `Log()` calls to write multiple lines, use a single call and include newline characters ('\n').

### Arguments
|Name|Type|Description|
|-|-|-
data|string|The text string to write to the log.

### Returns
|Type|Description|
|-|-
void|Returns nothing.
