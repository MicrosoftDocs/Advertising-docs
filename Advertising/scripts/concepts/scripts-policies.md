# Scripts policies

Here’s the list of things you can’t do (subject to change without notice):

- Don’t use Scripts to get around usage limits and restrictions. For example, if you use up your Bing Ads API usage limits, don’t switch to using Scripts to get around your limits.  
  
- Don’t use Scripts for any purpose that's not related to Microsoft Advertising.  
  
- Don’t use unsupported Scripts methods. For a list of supported objects and methods you may call, see [Scripts reference](../reference-overview.md).  
  
- Don’t abuse Scripts by sending a high volume of requests.  
  
- Don’t adversely impact the performance, functionality, or features of the Microsoft Advertising platform.

Additionally, you must follow the [best practices](best-practices.md). This is especially important for performance reasons when getting large numbers of entities such as more than one million entities or editing more than 100,000 entities daily.


## What happens if you violate any of these policies? 

**First you get notified**. Typically, Microsoft sends notification of the issues to the email addresses associated with the account.

**Then, your account is suspended**. If you don’t fix the issues within two business days of the notification email being sent, Microsoft may suspend your Scripts usage. In addition, Microsoft may also reduce your rate limits.

**However, if the issues are severe**, Microsoft may suspend your Scripts usage without prior notification. What constitutes a severe violation is left to Microsoft’s discretion. Certainly, anything that adversely impacts the performance, functionality, or features of the platform will constitute a severe violation of policy.


## Microsoft’s rights to monitor, audit, and review your scripts

Microsoft may review any Scripts activity. This could entail accessing your scripts to, among other things, check for security issues or vulnerabilities that could affect the Microsoft Advertising platform or other users. If requested, you must provide full access to all your scripts within two business days (this includes scripts not stored in Scripts).  

Any interference or obfuscation of Microsoft’s monitoring and auditing of your Scripts activity is not allowed.
