# What are iterators?

[!INCLUDE[preview-note](../includes/preview-note.md)]

Iterators enumerate items that a [selector](selectors.md) returns. Iterators are similar to arrays except you can't use an index to directly access an item. Iterators also help reduce memory pressure by loading only a single item at a time rather than the entire set of items. Iterators include the following methods.

- **boolean hasNext()** &mdash; Returns true if the current position is not the last item in the list
- **Object next()** &mdash; Advances the current position and returns the object at the new position
- **totalNumEntities()** &mdash; Returns the number of items available in the iterator.

The following code shows how to use an iterator to iterate over all ad groups in your account.

```javascript
var iterator = AdsApp.adGroups().get();

while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  var adGroup = iterator.next();
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The iterators don't support the **for-of** loop construct. For example:
>  
> ```javascript
>     for (var campaign of AdsApp.campaigns().get())
> ```
