# Supported JavaScript features

Microsoft Advertising Scripts’ JavaScript engine supports most of [ECMAScript® 2015 Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/). Use the auto-complete feature in the Scripts editor to confirm support of specific features and objects. Because the script’s code runs on Microsoft Advertising's servers, browser-based features like the DOM and Window APIs are not available.


> [!NOTE]
> The iterators don't support the **for-of** loop construct. For example:
>  
> ```javascript
>     for (var campaign of AdsApp.campaigns().get())
> ```
