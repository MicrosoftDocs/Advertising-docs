# Connecting social profiles

Rather than managing all your social profiles separately, you can manage the following social profiles in one place, right here through Digital Marketing Center:

- Facebook page
- Instagram Business account
- LinkedIn company page
- Twitter account

## Connect a Facebook Ads account

Before you can connect a Facebook page to Digital Marketing Center, you must first connect to your Facebook Ads account. We’ll use this account to create all Facebook ad campaigns from Digital Marketing Center. **Note**: You can only use one Facebook Ads account.

1. From the **Social** page, click **Link new profile** in the left menu.
1. In the **Facebook Ads account** section of the page, click **Connect to Facebook Ads account**.
1. Select the Facebook Ads account you want to use and click **Send access request**.
1. To continue, sign in to Facebook to verify and allow Microsoft Advertising access to your Facebook Ads account.

## Connect your social profiles

1. From the **Social** page, click **Link new profile** in the left menu.
1. Select the social profile you want to connect.
1. Enter your log in details and follow the steps to authorize the profile.

**Things to remember:**

- Don’t forget to accept all permissions, to allow Digital Marketing Center access to connect to a social profile.
- To access your Instagram Business account through Digital Marketing Center, be sure to link your Facebook page and Instagram Business account.
- You must be an admin for a Facebook page or Instagram Business account to be able to connect to Digital Marketing Center.

## Disconnect a social profile

1. From the **Social** page, click **Link new profile** in the left menu.
1. Under **Connected profiles**, look for the profile you want to remove and click **Disconnect**.

**What you need to know:**    If you disconnect a Facebook page from Digital Marketing Center, all your ads for that Facebook page across all Digital Marketing Center campaigns will be permanently removed. In addition, you won’t be able to add another Facebook page to specific campaigns.
