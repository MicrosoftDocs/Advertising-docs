# FAQ: Digital Marketing Center Billing

## What payment methods are accepted?
Digital Marketing Center accepts credit and debit cards only (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Network). We do not accept payments by prepaid cards.
## How do I add a new payment method?
1. In the upper-right corner of any Digital Marketing Center page, click the profile picture and click **Billing and payments**.
1. Click **Add new card** from the **Payment methods** tile.
1. From the **Set as** list, choose the payment method type.
   - To pay for search advertising in Digital Marketing Center, you must have a credit or debit card as your **Primary payment method**.
   - You can add a **Backup payment method** that will be charged if a payment charged to your primary payment method is unsuccessful.
   - If you’d like to add another card, you can add it as an **Additional payment method**. Please note, unlike a backup payment method, an additional payment method will not be charged if a payment using your primary payment method is unsuccessful.

1. From the list, select the country/region of your card’s billing address.
1. Enter your card details: The **Card number**, the **Expiration date**, the **Security code**, the **Name on card**, and the **Billing address**.
1. Click **Save**.

## How do I delete a payment method?
1. In the upper-right corner of any Digital Marketing Center page, click the profile picture and click **Billing and payments**.
1. Click **Remove** from the **How you pay for search advertising** tile.

**This is important** : You cannot remove your primary card without replacing it. If you only have one card in Digital Marketing Center, add another card, and assign it as the new primary card. Once that is updated, you can remove your previous primary card.

## How do I get billed?
In Digital Marketing Center, you accrue costs every time your ad is clicked. You're automatically charged on your monthly billing date, or when you reach a preset amount (known as your billing threshold), whichever comes first.

Your monthly billing date is the monthly anniversary of your sign-up date for Digital Marketing Center and cannot be changed.

## What is the billing threshold and how does it work?
When met, the billing threshold is a set amount that triggers billing for advertising costs. We charge your primary payment method when you reach your billing threshold or your monthly billing date, whichever comes first.

**For example** : In your first 30-day period, your charges are well below your billing threshold of $25, so we charge your primary payment method on your monthly billing date. In the next 30-day period, you hit your billing threshold a few days before your monthly billing date, so we charge your primary payment method at that time.

## What is my monthly billing date?
Your monthly billing date is the monthly anniversary of your sign-up date for Digital Marketing Center and cannot be changed. Your primary payment method will be charged on your monthly billing date with one exception:

If you have made a successful payment within the past 10 days, either by reaching your billing threshold or by paying your account balance.

## How do I pay my account balance?
1. In the upper-right corner of any Digital Marketing Center page, click the profile picture and click **Billing and payments**.
1. Click **Make a payment** from the **Current search advertising balance** tile.
1. Select the payment method you want to use.
1. Click **Pay now**.

## Do I need to pay taxes for my Digital Marketing Center account?
Because your business is located in the United States, billing is managed by Microsoft Online, Inc. in the United States, and Digital Marketing Center is not required to charge taxes on advertising costs.

Digital Marketing Center cannot provide guidance on tax. Please contact your tax advisor or local tax office if you have questions.

## What you need to know
- Partial payments are not accepted.
- You will be able to see how much you spend in search ads versus social ads, but you won’t be able to see the spend on each individual ad platform.
- You're automatically charged on your monthly billing date, or when you reach a preset amount (known as your billing threshold), whichever comes first. If your billing threshold is low, but the monthly spend is high, your card may be charged multiple times a month (each time the spend reaches your billing threshold).
