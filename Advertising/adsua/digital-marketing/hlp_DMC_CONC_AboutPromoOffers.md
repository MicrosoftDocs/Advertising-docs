# Digital Marketing Center promotional offers (coupons)

![Coupon](../images/BA_Conc_Coupon.svg)
Digital Marketing Center occasionally runs promotional offers, sometimes called **coupons**. Typically geared for new customers, promotional offers can require you to spend money on your advertising campaigns first to get a credit toward advertising. Although you can't request a promotional offer, you can find them through Digital Marketing Center promotional events, online marketing drives, or other special offers.

## Requirements for a promotional offer

- Before you can redeem your promotional offer, you must have a primary payment method for your account.
- Promotional codes can be redeemed only once. You or someone else cannot reuse a promotional code.
- Check the details of the promotional offer for the start and expiration dates. The date on the promotional offer must be current.
- You cannot use a promotional offer to pay for an existing balance.
- After a promotional offer has expired or the promotional amount runs out, your ads will continue to run, and we'll charge your primary payment method.
- Only one promotional offer can be active at any time.
- A promotional offer may contain other restrictions. Be sure to read the details of your offer for terms and conditions.

## What happens after I redeem my promotional offer?

- After you add a promotional code, you'll get a notification that the code was successfully added.
- Typically, a promotional balance appears once you fulfill the offer's requirements, such as a minimum spend.
- It can take up to 10 minutes for your offer to appear in your account.
- Once your promotional balance appears on the **Billing and payments** page, we will deduct your advertising costs from the promotional balance until the offer is used up or it expires. At that point, we will start charging your primary payment method.
- Please note that promotional balances are nonrefundable. Any remaining promotional balance is forfeited at the end of the promotional period.

## How to review promotional offer details and status

1. In the upper-right corner of any Digital Marketing Center page, click the profile picture and click **Billing and payments**.
1. On the **Promotional offers** tile, review any offers you may have.

> [!NOTE]
> An offer can have one of the following of statuses:
> 
> **Active:**  You successfully redeemed your promotional offer. It will be used for your ad spend up to the offer amount or until it reaches the expiration date, whichever comes first. Note: You can't have two active offers at the same time.
> 
> **Depleted:**  You have used all your offer balance for ad spend.
> 
> **Expired:**  The offer reached its expiration date, so it is no longer valid.
> 
> **Needs payment method:**  To redeem your promotional offer, you must add a payment method. The status will switch to "Active" after you add a valid payment method, unless the offer has expired.
> 
> **Pending:**  If you have two valid offers, one offer will be pending (on hold), while the other is active. When the active offer is expired or depleted, the pending offer will become active unless it has expired.
> 
> **Pending redemption:**  If you were unable to redeem your promotional offer, it will show this status. To redeem your offer, click **Redeem now**.
