# What is the billing threshold and how does it work?

[!INCLUDE [BillingThresholdDef](BillingThresholdDef)] We charge your primary payment method when you reach your billing threshold or your monthly billing date, whichever comes first.  For example,  in your first 30-day period, your charges are well below your billing threshold of $25, so we charge your primary payment method on your monthly billing date. In the next 30-day period, you hit your billing threshold a few days before your monthly billing date, so we charge your primary payment method at that time.

## Monthly billing date

Your monthly billing date is the date that you signed up for Digital Marketing Center. Your primary payment method will be charged on your monthly billing date with one exception:

- If you have made a successful payment within the past 10 days, either by reaching your billing threshold or by paying your account balance.

## Billing threshold

Billing thresholds start out low and will automatically increase when you make successful payments. The amount of increase depends on your currency and other factors. Alternatively, Digital Marketing Center automatically decreases your billing threshold if you run into problems paying your charges.

## Example: When you pay
Let’s assume you signed up for Digital Marketing Center on October 22 and have an account billed in U.S. dollars. As a new customer, your billing threshold is set by default to $25 and your monthly billing date is the 22nd of each month. From October 22 to November 21, you spend $23.50, so we charge you that amount on           November 22, your first monthly billing date. Your campaign takes off in late November and by December 7, you have $30 in charges. We charge your payment method on December 8. You reach the billing threshold 2 more times, and we increase it to $50.
