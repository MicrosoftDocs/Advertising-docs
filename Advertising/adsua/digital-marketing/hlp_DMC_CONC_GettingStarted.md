# Getting started on Digital Marketing Center

To get started on Digital Marketing Center, you’ll need to sign in with your Microsoft account. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, you can create one [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=238657). One thing to note – if you’re using a Microsoft account for Microsoft Advertising, you won’t be able to use the same one for Digital Marketing Center.

After you sign in with your Microsoft account...

1. Select if you want to advertise in search (Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads) and social networks (Facebook and Instagram) or if you just want to manage your social media (Facebook,  Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter).
1. Enter your business information. **This is important** : Your time zone will be based on your business location and cannot be changed once it’s set. In addition, only your phone number can be changed after setup.
1. Select the social networks you want to connect. You can connect up to 10 accounts or pages or skip this step for now. Next, select the Facebook Ads account you want to connect to (optional). **Note** : You can only associate one Facebook Ads account, which will be used for all the ad campaigns created in Digital Marketing Center.
1. Next is setting up your ad management.
   1. What's your advertising goal? Setting your goal at the very start gives us the content to craft effective ads for you.
      - **Visits to my website.**  Choose this goal if you want to drive more traffic to your website. Add your business website and select up to 10 categories from a set list of categories. If you want to create social ads, select the Facebook page you want to use for this campaign.
      - **Phone calls to my business.**  Choose this goal if you want more calls to your business. Add your business phone number, along with your business website, and select up to 10 categories from a set list of categories. If you want to create social ads, select the Facebook page you want to use for this campaign.
      - **Visits to my business location.**  Choose this goal if you want to get more people to visit your business location. Add your business website and select up to 10 categories from a set list of categories. If you want to create social ads, select the Facebook page you want to use for this campaign.

**Note** : Only one goal is allowed per campaign but you can always create more campaigns later.

   1. Set your advertising targets. Targets help you focus on the audience that matters most to you. You can target by country, state, city, or zip code. **Note** : Only locations in the United States are supported. 			 			Other targets, like age, gender, and device, will be optimized for your campaign based on Microsoft artificial intelligence.

1. Now that your advertising goal and targets are set, it’s time to create text ads that will be shown in Bing and Google. You can create up to 50 text, image, and video ads per campaign.
   - **Text ads** . Enter your ad titles, destination URL, and descriptions. As you enter the details, you can see how your ad may appear. 			 			**Note** : Digital Marketing Center will automatically generate ads for you as well, based on your website, Facebook page, and existing ads.
   - **Image ads** . Enter your ad title, text, and destination URL. Upload a .jpeg or .png image to be shown in both Facebook and Instagram with the following requirements:
      - Aspect ratio: 1:1
      - Minimum image dimensions: 720x720 pixels
      - Maximum image dimensions: None
      - File size: 20MB

   - **Video ads**  (optional). Enter your ad title, text, and destination URL. Upload a video to be shown in both Facebook and Instagram with the following requirements:
      - Video ratio: 9:16 to 16:9
      - File size: Up to 4GB
      - Length minimum: 1 second
      - Length maximum: 240 minutes
      - Captions: Optional but recommended
      - Sound: Optional but recommended
      - Resolution: Highest resolution video available that meets the file size and ratio limits

1. Set your budget. Your budget tells us the limit you want to spend per day on your ad campaign. Based on the information you have provided, we’ll recommend a monthly budget by default but you can also select your own. **This is important** : This amount includes ad spend across Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads. However, the spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook.
1. Review your campaign details, preview your ads, and confirm your budget and targeted locations.
1. Set up your payment method. Digital Marketing Center is free to use and you’ll only be charged for ad spend on ad platforms. Only credit or debit cards are accepted. **Note** : Prepaid cards are not accepted.
