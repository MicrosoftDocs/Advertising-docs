**Can I just use Microsoft Advertising or Google Ads for my search advertising?**	 	No, we set up your campaign in both Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads. The campaign performance is monitored in both platforms and our machine-learning algorithm optimizes the budget allocation to maximize your ad performance.

**If I already use Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads, can I just use my existing accounts? **	 	No, we’ll create new Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads accounts for you.

**How do automated ads work? **	 	We’ll use Microsoft AI to create automated text ads to be shown in Bing and Google, based on the business info and website URL you provide, as well as text ads you create. We continuously monitor and make necessary changes to optimize your ad performance.	  	Note: Automated ads are not generated for image ads or video ads that are shown in Facebook and Instagram.

**Can I turn off automated ads?**	 	No.

**Can I create my own ads?**	 	Yes, definitely! Go to the **Ads** page and click on the campaign you want to create ads for. From the **Ad preview** tile, click **View and edit ads**.

**How is the budget distributed across the different channels for search and social advertising?**	 	We monitor the performance in all channels and our machine-learning algorithm optimizes the budget allocation to maximize your ad performance.

**Can I see how much was spent by channel?**	 	You can see how much was spent on search and social but can’t see the specific amounts by channel.

**I can’t seem to find my Facebook Ads account – help!**	 	You’ll need either a Business Manager Facebook Ads account or a personal Facebook Ads account. Check out these [short videos on how to set up your Facebook Ads account](./hlp_DMC_CONC_VidDirectory.md).

**Can I make changes from my Facebook Ads account? **	 	You can access your Facebook Ads account but we recommend that you do not make changes to the campaigns directly from Facebook Ads. This is because any changes made outside of Digital Marketing Center to ad campaigns created in Digital Marketing Center will be automatically overridden. Instead, use Digital Marketing Center to make any changes to the ad campaigns created in Digital Marketing Center.

**Why can’t I see my ad on Bing or Google? Are my ads working?**	 	If you can’t find your ad on Bing or Google search results pages, here are some possible reasons:
- You’re searching from a location that you have not targeted.
- You’re running ad campaigns in Microsoft Advertising or Google Ads outside of Digital Marketing Center, which are showing instead. The search result pages show only one ad per domain.
- Automated ads created by Digital Marketing Center are showing instead of the ads created by you.
