# Special pages: Which pages are most important to your business?

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worryâ€”it's coming soon!

Some pages on your website are more important than others, depending on your business goal. By identifying these as **Special pages** when [setting up customer action tracking](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CAT_Intro.md), Digital Marketing Center can give you more detailed information about how customers interact with them. This is the insight you need to ensure you're getting the return on investment (ROI) you want from your ad campaign.

## What are my special pages?

Start with your business goal:

- If you're trying to **sell products**, then your special pages might be product description pages and order confirmation pages.
- If you're trying to **generate leads**, then your special pages might be sign-up pages.
- If you're trying to **raise brand awareness**, then your special pages might be blog posts about your brand.

> [!NOTE]
> Do you have multiple business goals for the same website? For example, maybe you want to sell products, but also drive service-plan adoption. We strongly recommend creating a separate ad campaign for each goal. That way, you can have separate ads, performance metrics, and budgets for each.

## Special page types

We provide some suggested page types to help you identify your special pages. Depending on your business goals, only some of our suggestions will be applicable to your website. Our suggested page types are:

## URLs for special pages

When you [set up customer action tracking](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CAT_Intro.md) and add a special page, the qualifier (Contains, Equals, or Begins with) gives you flexibility in how you define the special page URL. This will help you get detailed information about customer visits to these URLs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Qualifier</th>
    <th scope="col">Example</th>
    <th scope="col">Why you might use it</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equals</td>
    <td>www.contoso.com/us/menswear/Contoso5000/xy/sizing</td>
    <td>You want details about customer visits to one specific page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">Contains</td>
    <td>Contoso5000</td>
    <td>You want details about customer visits to any URL with your domain that contains this specific brand in the URL.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>thankyou</td>
    <td>You want details about customer visits to every product confirmation page on your website that contains this phrase in its URL.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Begins with</td>
    <td>www.contoso.com/promotional-offers</td>
    <td>You want details about customer visits to any page on your website that has a URL that begins with this URL.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
