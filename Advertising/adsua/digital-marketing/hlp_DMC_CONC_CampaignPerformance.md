# Campaign performance

Now that you’ve created search ad campaigns, you’re probably wondering how your ads are performing. Head over to the **All campaigns** page, where you’ll see details showing:

- Budget
- Ad performance by platform

Selecting a specific campaign from the left menu will show tiles with the following details:

## Campaign metrics (Impressions, Clicks, Direction Inquiries, Calls, Spend, and Engagement)

|Metric|What it means|
|---|---|
|Impressions|Measure of how visible your ads are, given your budget and location targeting.|
|Clicks|Clicks are how many times your ads were clicked. It’s a good measure of how appealing your ads are to the people who see them.|
|Direction inquiries|The number of clicks on your ads with the "Direction inquiries" button.|
|Calls|The number of calls this campaign’s ads have resulted in over time, if the campaign’s goal is **Get more phone calls to my business**.|
