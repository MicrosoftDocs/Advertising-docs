# How budgets work

The budget you set for your Digital Marketing Center ad campaigns tells us how much you want to spend per day on your ad campaign. Once you reach your budget, Digital Marketing Center will stop displaying your ads until the next day. This way, you only spend as much as you’re comfortable with. Don’t forget that this amount includes ad spend across Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads. However, the spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook.    So, how do you know what amount is right for you?

## Choosing an ad campaign budget

You only pay when someone clicks on one of your ads, so a good way to think about your campaign budget is in terms of clicks and cost per click (CPC). So, how many clicks do you hope to get each day and how much is each click worth to you?

For example, if you want the ads in your campaign to get 50 clicks a day and you decide that each click is work a maximum CPC of $0.40. Multiply $0.40 by 50 to get a budget of $20 per day.

After your ads begin to appear in the Microsoft Search Network, Google, and Facebook, you’ll be able to see the number of impressions and clicks your ads receive.

- An **impression** is when your ad is shown to a potential customer. It’s a good way to measure how visible your ads are, given your budget and location targeting.
- A **click** is when one of those potential customers clicks on your ad. It’s a good way to measure how appealing your ads are to people who see them. Most importantly, clicks are what you pay for. You’ll pay Digital Marketing Center when someone clicks your ad for Microsoft Advertising and Google ads. You’ll be billed directly by Facebook for any spend.

Keep an eye on this data, which can be found by clicking on the campaign from the **Ads** page. The impressions and clicks will change, based on your budget and targeted locations, giving you an idea of how to tweak your campaign to maximize your return on spend.

## Changing your budget amount

Your budget is set when you initially create your ad campaign, but you can subsequently change your budget at any time.

1. From the **Ads** page, click the campaign whose budget you want to change.
1. Click the pencil icon next to your daily budget.
1. Update your daily budget. You can use the slider to see what the estimated monthly budget would be, based on what you input for the daily budget.
1. Click **Save**.

**This is important**: Your actual spend per day might be more or less than the target budget you’ve set. But each month, you won’t spend more than the budget entered multiplied by 30.1.

## What you need to know about budgets

There are a few important things you need to know about budgets:

- Your daily limit is a target, which means that your actual spend might be higher or lower. This is because a monthly budget is calculated and then actual budget limit is calculated for an entire month.
- Any changes, including budget changes, made outside of Digital Marketing Center to ad campaigns created by Digital Marketing Center will be automatically overridden. Use Digital Marketing Center to make any changes to the ad campaigns created by Digital Marketing Center.
- The budget covers ads on Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads. However, any spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook.
- To have your Facebook Ads serve, you must have your payment method set up for your Facebook Ads account.
