# Social reports

Now that you’ve connected your social profiles, you’re probably wondering how your audience is responding. From the **Social** page, click **Reports** from the left menu.

Selecting all or a specific social profile from the left menu will show tiles with the following details, within the time period you select from the date picker:

## Social metrics (Impressions, Engagement, and Audience growth)
