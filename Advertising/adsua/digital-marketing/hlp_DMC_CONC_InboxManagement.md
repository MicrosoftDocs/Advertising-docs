# Inbox management

After you connect your social profiles, you’ll begin to receive new interactions from your customers right in your **Inbox**. From your **Inbox**, you can:

- Reply to public comments and posts on your public Facebook pages.
- Reply to your private Facebook page messages.
- Comment and reply on your Instagram Business posts.
- Reply to your direct Twitter account messages.
- Reply, like, or retweet Tweets you are mentioned in.
- Reply to comments on your LinkedIn posts.

Your inbox will contain all inbound comments, wall posts, and private messages across your social profiles in chronological order, for up to 90 days. New posts will appear in the **To review** tab and once you mark a post as **Complete**, you can view all posts in the **All** tab.

## View posts

From your **Inbox**, you can view all posts from all social profiles or you can select specific social profile’s posts to view. From the **Social** page, click **Inbox** from the main menu on the left. By default, all social profiles’ posts are displayed but to view specific profiles’ posts, you can select the social profiles from the main menu on the left.

Clicking on each post from the list will open it on the right. From here, you can **Like**, **Reply to**, or **Delete** the post.

## Reply to posts

To reply to posts, click **Reply** and enter your response. Once you have responded to a post, it’ll automatically be marked as **Complete**. You can also click **Complete** on posts you don’t want to respond to.

## Filter posts

You can customize what posts you want to see by applying filters, making your inbox management faster and easier. Just above the posts, you’ll find the filtering options that allow you to filter by days and activity types. You can view posts from the last 90, 30, 7 days or 24 hours. You can also filter by **Activity Types** and select to view wall posts, comments, reviews, or private messages.
