# Editorial reviews and disapproved ads

## The editorial review

After you submit an ad in Digital Marketing Center, all ad components—ad text, images, and links—must pass an editorial review for the advertising platform that will run your ad. This is a quality check to help ensure that your ads are relevant, clear, accurate, and appropriate for potential customers. Familiarizing yourself with advertising policies can make the approval process much quicker.

Each advertising platform approves or disapproves your ads based on their advertising policies:

- **Search ads** : Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising
- **Social ads** : Facebook Advertising (for ads on Facebook and Instagram)

|Type of ad|Results of editorial reviews|What happens|
|---|---|---|
|Search|Both Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising approve your ad.|Your ad becomes active and is eligible to run on both platforms.|
|Search|Microsoft Advertising approves your ad, but Google Ads disapproves your ad.|Your ad receives a **Partially disapproved** status in Digital Marketing Center. The ad is eligible to run on Microsoft Advertising, but not eligible to run on Google while it's disapproved.|
|Search|Google Ads approves your ad, but Microsoft Advertising disapproves your ad.|Your ad receives a **Partially disapproved** status in Digital Marketing Center. The ad is eligible to run on Google, but not eligible to run on Microsoft Advertising while it's disapproved.|
|Search|Both Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising disapprove your ad.|Your ad receives a **Disapproved** status in Digital Marketing Center and won’t run on either platform.|
|Social|Facebook Advertising approves your ad.|Your ad becomes active and is eligible to run on Facebook and Instagram.|
|Social|Facebook Advertising disapproves your ad.|Your ad receives a **Disapproved** status in Digital Marketing Center and won’t run on Facebook or Instagram while it's disapproved.|

**What you need to know** :

- The editorial status can be found on the **Ads** page in the **Disapproved ads** tile. You can also find the status in a specific advertising campaign in the **Ad preview** tile.
- Editorial checks do not stop once an ad is live. There are ongoing reviews to help ensure a quality marketplace. For this reason, previously displayed ads may be disapproved.

## Determine the reason for the disapproved status and review the policy

1. On the **Ads** page, click the campaign with disapproved ads.
1. On the **Ad preview** tile, find the disapproved ad, and click **Disapproved** or **Partially disapproved**.
1. Review the advertising platform that disapproved the ad and the policy violation.
1. Click the link to the policy and review the details of the policy violation.
   - For Facebook Advertising, the link takes you to [Facebook Advertising policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2131968) that apply to ads on Facebook and Instagram, where you can search for the specific policy that applies to your ad and review their standards.
   - For Google Ads, the link takes you to [Google Ads policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2131967), where you can search for the specific policy that applies to your ad and review their standards.
   - For Microsoft Advertising, the link takes you to the specific policy that applies to your ad. View all the [Microsoft Advertising policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341).

After you’ve reviewed the policy, you can:

- Edit your ad to comply with the policies for the platform that disapproved it.
- Challenge the disapproval by requesting an exception.

## Edit disapproved ads to comply with policies

1. On the **Ad preview** tile, click **View and edit all ads**.
1. Click **Edit** in the preview of the disapproved ad.
