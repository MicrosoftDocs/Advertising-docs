# About search and social ads

Advertising campaigns in Digital Marketing Center are a simple and easy way for you to advertise your products or services. You can run both search and social ads, or just run search ads.

## Search ads

Create text ads to run on Google and Bing. When people search for words or phrases related to your products or services, text ads display on their search results pages.

In addition to text ads you create, we'll use Microsoft artificial intelligence (AI) to build text ads to help optimize your search advertising campaigns for you. [Learn more about automated text ads](./hlp_DMC_CONC_AboutAutomatedAds.md).

## Social ads

Create image or video ads to run on Facebook and Instagram. When people view their social media feeds, image and video ads display in them.

When you create image ads for social media, we'll provide suggested ads you can use to make ad creation faster and easier. You can create your own ads and choose from suggested ads (editing them, if you like, or using them just as they are).

## Stages of the ad creation and submission process

1. First, [create an advertising campaign](./hlp_DMC_PROC_CampaignCreation.md), or you can create new ads for an existing campaign.
1. Within the advertising campaign, create text ads for search platforms (Google and Bing), and image or video ads for social platforms (Facebook and Instagram). Learn how to [create text ads](./hlp_DMC_PROC_CreateTextAds.md) or to [create image or video ads](./hlp_DMC_PROC_CreateImageVideoAds.md).
1. To finish setting up your campaign and to get your ads up and running, set your advertising budget, verify your campaign details, and submit your campaign. Learn more about [how budgets work](./hlp_DMC_CONC_Budgets.md).
1. After you submit your campaign, Digital Marketing Center performs a quick review of your ad content against advertising policies (most reviews take less than a day). After that, your ads will start running. Learn more about [editorial reviews and disapproved ads](./hlp_DMC_CONC_UnderstandDisapprovedAds.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [Set up customer action tracking](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CAT_Intro.md) to learn what potential customers do after they click your ad, including the pages they visit on your website, how long they spend there, and more! Customer action tracking can give you a clearer picture of your return on investment (ROI) for your advertising campaigns.

## Monitor your ads and campaigns

On the **Ads** page, you can monitor how your [campaigns are performing](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CampaignPerformance.md). Youâ€™ll see tiles containing:
- Search and social metrics, including Impressions, Clicks, Direction inquiries, Calls, Conversions, Spend, and Engagement
- A performance graph showing metrics by platform
