## Create image and video ads in a new advertising campaign

First, [create an advertising campaign](./hlp_DMC_PROC_CampaignCreation.md). Set your campaign goal, choose that you want to run search and social ads, then create ads:

1. **Ad title** : The ad title serves as a link to your website. The best way to encourage customers to find and click your ad is to include keywords in your ad title that relate to the product or service you're advertising.
1. **Ad text** : The ad text appears above your image or video in your ad. Use the ad text to convince people to click your ad. What sets your product or service apart? Is it the price? Does it solve a problem or provide a benefit? Include a reason for customers to click **right now** (a call to action).
1. **Final URL** : This is the webpage URL that potential customers go to when they click your ad. If you send a potential customer to a webpage that is tailored to what your ad highlights, such as a product page, sign-up page, or contact page, they're more likely to take action.
1. **Image or video** : You can choose a suggested image or upload one of your own images. If you're creating a video ad, upload your video file. Use a compelling image or video for your product or service to encourage people to click on your ad. [Learn more about image and video requirements](./hlp_DMC_CONC_ImageVideoRequirements.md).
1. **Image or video ad preview** : The preview shows a sample ad, based on your ad elements.
