# Performance by channels

**What it is:** Performance comparison of your channels (paid search ads, paid social ads, and free social media posts) for the selected metric during the selected date range.

**What you need to know:**
- Not all metrics apply to every channel. Clicks and spend don't apply to social media posts, and engagements don't apply to paid search ads.
