# Clicks

**What it is:**  The number of times your ads were clicked during the selected date range.

**What you need to know:**
- Clicks are a good measure of how appealing your ads are to the people who see them.
- A dash (--) displays if there’s no data available for the selected date range or if a metric doesn’t apply.
- Clicks don't apply to social media posts.
- For social ads, the number of clicks can include:
   - Clicks on links
   - Likes, comments, or shares
   - Clicks to a Facebook page or an Instagram profile
   - Clicks to expand a photo or video to full screen
