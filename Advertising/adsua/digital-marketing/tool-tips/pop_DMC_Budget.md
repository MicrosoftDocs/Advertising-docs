# Campaign budget

**What it is:**  Your budget tells us how much you want to spend on this campaign per day.

**What you need to know:**
- Any changes, including budget changes, made outside of Digital Marketing Center to ad campaigns created by Digital Marketing Center will be automatically overridden. Use Digital Marketing Center to make any changes to the ad campaigns created by Digital Marketing Center.
- The budget covers ads on Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads. However, any spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook.
- To have your Facebook Ads serve, you must have your payment method set up for your Facebook Ads account.
- Your daily limit is a target, which means that your actual spend might be higher or lower.
- You can change your budget at any time.
