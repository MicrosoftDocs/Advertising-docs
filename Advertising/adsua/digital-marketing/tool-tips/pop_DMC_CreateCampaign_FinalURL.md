# Final URL

**What it is:** The webpage potential customers go to when they click your ad.

**What you need to know:** If you send a potential customer to a webpage that is tailored to what your ad highlighted, such as a product page, sign-up page, or contact page, they're more likely to take action. For example, your ad describes a product you’re selling on your website. The potential customer clicks your ad and goes to that product’s page with an add to cart button.
