# Ad title part 3 (optional)

**What it is:**  Ad title part 3 appears after ad title part 1 and 2, separated by a vertical bar (|). The ad title is the most prominent part of your ad and serves as a link to your website.

**What you need to know:**  The best way to encourage customers to find and click your ad is to include relevant keywords in your ad title.
