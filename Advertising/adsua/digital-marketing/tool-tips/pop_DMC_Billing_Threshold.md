# Billing threshold

**What it is:**  A set amount that triggers billing for advertising costs. We charge your primary payment method when you reach your billing threshold or your monthly billing date, whichever comes first. [Learn more](../hlp_DMC_CONC_BillingThreshold.md)

**What you need to know:**
- **This is important:**  Your billing threshold isn’t the same as setting your budget. When you create an advertising campaign, you set your budget to tell us the limit you want to spend per day on your ad campaign.
- Digital Marketing Center determines your billing threshold, which starts out low and automatically increases when you make successful payments.
- If you run into problems paying your charges, Digital Marketing Center automatically decreases your billing threshold.
