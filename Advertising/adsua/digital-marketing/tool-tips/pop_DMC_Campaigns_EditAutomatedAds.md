# Editing automated text ads

**What it is:**  You’re editing an ad that our AI built for your campaign based on your business info, your website, and text ads you created.

**What you need to know:**
- If you save changes, our AI will no longer optimize this ad. You’re the only one who will be able to change this ad in the future.
- If you want our AI to continue to optimize this ad, you can copy it first, then edit the duplicate ad.
