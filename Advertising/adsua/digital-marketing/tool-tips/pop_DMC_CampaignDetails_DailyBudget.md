# Daily budget

**What it is:**    Your budget tells us how much you want to spend on this campaign per day.

**What you need to know:**
- You can change your budget at any time.
- Your daily limit is a target, which means that your actual spend may be higher or lower. This is because Microsoft Advertising estimates your monthly budget, then calculates the monthly charge based on the actual ad spend on the different platforms: Microsoft Advertising, Google, and Facebook.
