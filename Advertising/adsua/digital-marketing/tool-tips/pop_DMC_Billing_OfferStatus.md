# Offer status

[Learn more about promotional offers](../hlp_DMC_CONC_AboutPromoOffers.md)

**Active:**  You successfully redeemed your promotional offer. It will be used for your ad spend up to the offer amount or until it reaches the expiration date, whichever comes first. Note: You can't have two active offers at the same time.

**Depleted:**  You have used all your offer balance for ad spend.

**Expired:**  The offer reached its expiration date, so it is no longer valid.

**Needs payment method:**  To redeem your promotional offer, you must add a payment method. The status will switch to "Active" after you add a valid payment method, unless the offer has expired.

**Pending:**  If you have two valid offers, one offer will be pending (on hold), while the other is active. When the active offer is expired or depleted, the pending offer will become active unless it has expired.

**Pending redemption:**  If you were unable to redeem your promotional offer, it will show this status. To redeem your offer, click **Redeem now**.
