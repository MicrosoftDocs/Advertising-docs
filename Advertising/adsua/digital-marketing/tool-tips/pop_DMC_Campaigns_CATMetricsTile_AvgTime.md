# Average time spent on your website

**What it is:**  The average time customers spent on your website after clicking your ad, during the selected date range.

**What you need to know:**
- Data collection begins after you add your tracking tag to your website’s code.
- A zero displays if there's no data available for the selected date range—either because the selected date range is before you set up customer action tracking or because you received no traffic from your ad in this date range.
