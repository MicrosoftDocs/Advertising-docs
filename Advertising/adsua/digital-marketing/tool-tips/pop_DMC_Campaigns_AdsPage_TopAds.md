# Top ads

**What they are:**  Your top performing ads in this campaign in the last 14 days.

**What you need to know:**
- Top performing ads are determined by many factors, including the number of clicks and impressions.
- After your campaign starts running, it may take some time for it to start performing. Once it does, you can view your top performing ads on the **Top ads** tab.
- If you paused your campaign or the ads in the campaign aren't performing, the **Top ads** tab may be blank.
