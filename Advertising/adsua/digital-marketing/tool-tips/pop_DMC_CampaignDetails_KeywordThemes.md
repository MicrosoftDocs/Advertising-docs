# Keyword themes

**What it is:**     Keyword themes are words or phrases that help match your ads in this campaign with searches on Bing or Google

**What you need to know:**
- A single keyword theme represents many similar words and phrases.
- We add keyword themes that seem to match what you offer on your website, but you can edit them if they don’t match what you want to advertise.
- Selecting the right keyword themes helps you reach people when they’re looking for the products and services that you’re advertising in this campaign.
