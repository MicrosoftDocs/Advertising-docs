# Add tracking tags to your website

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

A critical part of [setting up customer action tracking](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CAT_Intro.md) is adding the tracking tag to your website's code. You have the choice to add the tag to your website's code yourself or to email the tag to someone else who will do it for you. You or the person who updates your code can use the following instructions.

## Copy your tracking tag in Digital Marketing Center

1. From the **Ads** page, click a campaign.
1. Find the **Customer action tracking** tile.
1. Click the ellipsis icon ![More information icon](../images/BA_ScreenCap_DeliveryDetails.png), select **View tracking tag**, and click **Copy tag**.

> [!NOTE]
> If someone else is adding the tracking tag to your website for you, they can copy the tag from the email they receive from Digital Marketing Center. The email also has a link to this help article.

## Add the tracking tag to your website directly

1. Open the HTML for each webpage of your website.
1. Paste the tracking tag anywhere in the head section of your website's code (before the closing head tag: &lt;/head&gt;).
1. Save the changes to your webpages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the tag is on every page of your website.

 
## Add the tracking tag using a website platform

If you created and manage your website with one of the following website platforms, you can use it to add and manage your tracking tag.
