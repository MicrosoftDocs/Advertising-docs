# I'm having trouble adding a credit card or debit card

Adding credit cards and debit cards to Digital Marketing Center is easy and safe, but if you run into problems, take a look at the tips below.

## The credit card was added but was not set as your primary payment method for this account.
Follow these steps to set a credit or debit card as your primary payment method:

1. In the upper-right corner of any Digital Marketing Center page, click the profile picture, and click **Billing and payments**.
1. In the **Payment methods** tile, find the card you want to make your primary payment method.
1. In the drop-down list, choose **Primary payment method**.

Once you have associated a valid credit or debit card with your account, your ads will be eligible to run.

## The information that you have entered into Digital Marketing Center doesn't precisely match the information on file with your credit card company.
Here are common problems with entering credit card info:

- Enter your name precisely as it appears on the card. Only include your middle initial if it appears on your card.
- If your address exceeds the Address 1 field, use the Address 2 field. Do not shorten or abbreviate your address.
- The card number and type cannot be edited, so if you make a mistake, you'll need to add a new one with the correct information.

## The card number was entered with dashes or spaces.
Enter the credit card number without spaces or punctuation.

## The credit card you are trying to use requires you to enter a PIN/security verification when making a payment.
Digital Marketing Center doesn't accept cards that require you to enter a PIN/security verification when making a payment. Use a different credit card or form of payment.

## The card you are trying to use is a prepaid card.
Digital Marketing Center doesn't accept prepaid cards.

## You are trying to enter a credit card into an inactive account.
Inactive accounts cannot be reactivated if they are associated with an expired or otherwise invalid payment method or if the account has had too many declined payments.

- If your account is inactive, try adding a valid payment method.
- If you are unable to add a valid payment method, create a new account and enter your credit or debit card information in the new account.

## You are trying to use a card that is not authorized for online purchases or automatic billing.
Contact your credit card company to make sure youâ€™re authorized to use this card for online purchases and automatic billing.

## The credit card has expired, has been reported lost or stolen, has reached its transaction limit, or is new and hasn't been activated.
In any of these situations, you'll need to contact your credit card company.

## Multi-factor authentication was required, but has failed.
Your bank might require multi-factor authentication to help prevent online fraud and unauthorized access to your account. If the one-time passcode didn't work, try resending the code or adding the card again. If this doesn't resolve the issue, please contact your bank to validate your information.
