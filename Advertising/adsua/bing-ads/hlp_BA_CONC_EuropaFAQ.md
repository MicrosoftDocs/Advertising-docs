# Why we need your business location (and maybe VAT information)

Microsoft Advertising is required to collect value-added tax (VAT) in certain countries/regions, and so all advertisers must provide the business location for each of their accounts.

## How does this affect me?

All Microsoft Advertising customers need to have a business location listed for each of their accounts. Business location is the country/region where the advertiser's business is legally registered. Whether you will be charged VAT on your advertising costs will depend on your business location and your tax registration status. For example, if you are in a business location that has VAT accounting obligations, you will need to enter your VAT registration number. If you do not provide your VAT registration number, Microsoft Advertising will charge VAT, in most cases. VAT will be charged based on your local rate.

Customers in these locations will be billed by Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. (Formerly, Microsoft Advertising customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were billed by Microsoft Online, Inc.) Because the billing entity is located in the European Union, the purchase of Microsoft Advertising advertising services is subject to VAT in some business locations.

## More questions?

Here are more frequently asked questions.

## What is value-added tax?
Value-added tax, or VAT, is a consumption tax that is assessed on goods and services consumed in the European Union and in other countries. VAT is charged to the customer as a percentage of the price of the goods or services sold. The collected VAT is transferred to the appropriate tax authority.

## What is a VAT registration number?
A VAT registration number (also called a VAT identification number) identifies a business who has registered to pay VAT, if required, directly to their local tax authority. In European Union countries, the VAT registration number starts with 2 letters that are specific to each country/region, followed by a maximum of 12 numbers or letters. After you enter your VAT registration number, validation can take up to 3 days. You will be notified in Microsoft Advertising if there was a problem validating your VAT registration number.

## What is a VAT exemption certificate?
A VAT exemption certificate is a document that identifies a company as an organization that is exempted from paying VAT (for example, a registered charity).

## How do I add a VAT exemption certificate?
If you are exempt from paying VAT, please contact your account manager or customer support. They will need an electronic version of your VAT exemption certificate (PDF, JPG, or PNG) to put on file. Each VAT exemption certificate must undergo a review process that can take up to a week.

## I'm an agency. Do you want my company's business location or the business location for my client?
Business location is based on your client (the sold-to customer). If applicable, VAT registration number and VAT exemption certificates need to be those of your client as well.

Note: If you’re an agency based in India that advertises and pays the bill on behalf of a client, please make sure you enter your agency’s business information so that it is reflected correctly on the billing documents.

## I'm from a country/region that has VAT requirements. What changes will I see in my billing invoices and statements?
**If you have provided a VAT registration number,**  you will see your VAT registration number listed and a VAT 0% reverse charge in the subtotal section of your monthly invoice, statement, or credit memo.

**If you have not provided a VAT registration number,**  you will see the VAT rate in the subtotal section and the charge to your account. The VAT rate is based on your local rate.

**If you have provided a VAT exemption certificate,**  you will see on your invoice or statement that the  certificate is **on file** and the VAT rate will be 0%.

## I'm a customer in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa. What changes will I see in my billing invoices and statements?
After the transition from Microsoft Online, Inc., to Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd., monthly invoices and statements will come from Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd. The new payment instructions will be shown on the invoice.

## Why haven't I seen the request to enter a business location?
Most monthly invoiced customers will already have a business location and VAT information, if applicable, in our system. Also, you or someone at your business might have been contacted by an account manager or another Microsoft Advertising team member to get your business location into our system. In these cases, you won't see a request when you log in.

## How do I edit my business location?
If you are a monthly invoice customer and need to change your business location, please contact your account manager.

1. [!INCLUDE [PreferencesAccountSettings](./includes/PreferencesAccountSettings.md)]
1. Next to the **Account settings** page title, click the pencil icon ![edit icon](../images/BA_icon_edit.png).
