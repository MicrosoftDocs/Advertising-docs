# Imposto sobre Serviços

In Brazil, billing is managed by Microsoft do Brasil Importação e Comércio de Software e Games LTDA. Microsoft Advertising is required to charge Imposto sobre Serviços (ISS) at 2.9% on advertising costs in Brazil. (Note: tax rate is subject to change.)

You'll be asked for your CNPJ or CPF number when you sign up for Microsoft Advertising and each time you create a new account. Effective 1 January 2019, business accounts registered in the municipality of São Paulo must also provide a CCM registration number (Inscrição Municipal). Along with a valid business address, you'll need that tax ID on file in order to transact with Microsoft Advertising. Both items are required to generate a Nota Fiscal eletrônica that documents a transaction.

## How is ISS applied to my account?

The ISS is included as a gross up in any amount owed for postpay threshold and monthly invoice accounts. For prepay accounts, this 2.9% tax is deducted from payments. (Note: tax rate is subject to change.)

Regardless of how you pay, your billing document will include a separate line item for the ISS.

## Postpay threshold and monthly invoice accounts
**If you have a postpay threshold or monthly invoice account,**  the tax is included in the total amount. For example, if you owe a total of R$102.99, then R$100 is for ad spend and R$2.99 is for ISS. Here is the breakdown:           Tax basis: 1 - 2.9% = 0.971           Ad spend: R$100           Total amount due: R$100 / 0.971 = R$102.99           ISS amount: R$102.99 - R$100.00 = R$2.99

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For monthly invoice accounts, the insertion order budget only applies to ad spend. If you have a strict budget limit, you will need to account for taxes.

## Prepay accounts
**If you have a prepay account,**  the ISS is deducted from your payment. For example, if you make a R$100 prepayment, your account balance will increase by R$97.10 and the remainder of your payment (R$2.90) will cover the 2.9% tax. Here is the breakdown:         Prepay amount: R$100         Tax basis: 1 - 2.9% = 0.971         Account balance increase: R$100 \* 0.971 = R$97.10         Amount held for ISS: R$100 - R$97.10 = R$2.90
