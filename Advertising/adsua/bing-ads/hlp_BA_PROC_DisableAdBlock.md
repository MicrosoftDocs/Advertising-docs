# How do I disable ad-blocking extensions?

Ad-blocking extensions keep the [Ad Preview and Diagnostics Tool](./hlp_BA_PROC_UsingAdPreviewTool.md) from correctly previewing your ads, and may cause problems with other Microsoft Advertising  tools as well.

## To turn off ad-blocking extensions:

## Microsoft Internet Explorer
1. Click the gear icon to open **Tools** and select the **Manage Add-ons** option.
1. Click on **Toolbars and Extensions**, located in the left navigation pane.
1. Right-click on your ad-blocking extension, then click **Disable**.
1. [!INCLUDE [Refresh](./includes/Refresh.md)]

## Google Chrome
1. Click the menu icon at the top-right corner of the browser then select **More tools** &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; **Extensions**.
1. Uncheck the box next to **Enabled** corresponding to your ad-blocking extension.
1. [!INCLUDE [Refresh](./includes/Refresh.md)]

## Mozilla Firefox
1. Click the menu icon at the top-right corner of your browser and then choose **Add-ons**.
1. Click the **Disable** button corresponding to your ad-blocking extension.

## Safari
1. Click on **Safari** in the menu bar and choose **Preferences**.
