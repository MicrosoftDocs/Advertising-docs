# Understand and use product groups

## What are product groups?

Once you create a shopping campaign, Microsoft Advertising creates a default ad group. Within this ad group is a single product group that contains all the products from your Microsoft Merchant Center feed. This product group is what you use to bid on instead of keywords and all the products within this product group uses the same bid.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to understand product groups, first make sure you are familiar with both [product ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutProductAds.md) and [shopping campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_BSC_Overview.md).

We recommend that you break down the single product group into smaller product groups, so that each product group contains closely related products. This will help you manage which ads to show, and when to show them. With product groups, you can narrow down the default group into a customized list of specific products and divide up to 5 levels for each product group.

## About product group performance data
- Structural changes to product groups, like updating or deleting product groups, appear immediately in the table.
- Structural changes often necessitate the redistribution of existing performance data across the new structure. Once the data has been reprocessed and is up to date, you will no longer see the alert above the table.

## What you need to know
- There is a 1 to 1 relationship between ad groups and product groups. In other words, each ad group has one product group and vice versa.
- You can view your product groups on the **Product Group** tab within each ad group.
- When viewing your product group, if there is a small triangle to the left of an item in the **Product Group** column, that row has been divided further by some other attribute. Click the triangle to expand that row and see the more granular segments.
- Remember to "exclude" items that you don't want to be in your product group.
- You can narrow down a product group in your catalog feed up to 5 levels. For example, Office supplies > Office instruments > Writing and drawing instruments > Pens and pencils > Pens > New
