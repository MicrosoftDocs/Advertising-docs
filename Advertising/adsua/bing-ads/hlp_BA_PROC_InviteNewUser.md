# How do I access Microsoft Advertising as an invited user?

You have been invited as a new user to Microsoft Advertising. Make sure you understand what role you've been given, because it will determine what you can access and do in the account. Learn more [about user roles](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md).

Before you sign in, there are a couple of things that are good to know:

- If you don’t see the “Invitation to Microsoft Advertising” email shortly after the administrator for the account has invited you, check to make sure that it wasn’t delivered to your junk mail folder.
- You have 30 days to activate your account after you receive the “Invitation to Microsoft Advertising” email.

1. Find the email that was sent to you from Microsoft Advertising with the subject line "Invitation to Microsoft Advertising."
1. In the email, under **To get started**, click the link.
1. Choose the option that's best for you:
   - If the invitation is addressed to the email address you want to sign in with, then you'll just need to confirm your contact information (such as the email address that you'd like to use to receive critical alerts, which can be different from your user name), agree to the Microsoft Advertising Terms and Conditions, and click **Save**.           -or-
   - If you want to sign in with a different email address or create a new one, select **sign in using a different email address**, and then select **Sign in with a different Microsoft account** in the new window. You'll be prompted to enter a different email address or to create a new one. Once your email address is set up, you can create an account so that you can access Microsoft Advertising.

Once you've completed setup, you'll be taken back to Microsoft Advertising.

**Problems with the email address you are using?**

- Remember that you can only use an email address (a Microsoft account) to sign in to Microsoft Advertising. See [We're changing the way you sign in](./hlp_BA_CONC_MSAFAQ.md) for more information.
- If you have multi-user access, you'll need to use your consolidated user name and password to sign in to Microsoft Advertising. When enabled, multi-user access allows you to use one user name and password to access other people's manager accounts and the ad accounts they own. To learn more, see [Managing your user name to access multiple accounts](./hlp_BA_CONC_UserNamePermissions.md).
