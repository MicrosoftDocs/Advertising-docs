# Smart campaigns: Budgets and what you pay for

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Your budget tells us the limit you want to spend per day on your smart campaign. When you reach your budget, Microsoft Advertising will stop displaying your ads until the next day. This ensures you spend only as much as you're comfortable spending.

## Setting your budget

You first set a budget when you [create a smart campaign](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Intro.md), but you can subsequently change your budget at any time.

1. From the **All Campaigns** page, click **Campaign details** for the campaign you want to edit.
1. Click **Edit budget**.
1. Update your budget.
1. Click **Save**.

The shaded area along the budget slider shows you the range of budgets used by business like yours (based on your business category and products or services). This gives you an idea of what budget level will make your ads competitive.

Try entering different values and watch the **Estimated performance** window. Based on your budget, your targeted locations, and the products or services you set, we'll show you how many **impressions** and **clicks** we estimate your ads will get.
- An **impression** is when your ad is shown to a potential customer. Impressions are a good measure of how visible your ads are, given your budget, location targeting, and selected products or services.
- A **click** is when one of those people clicks on your ad. Clicks are a good measure of how appealing your ads are to the people who see them. Most importantly, **clicks are what you pay for**â€”you only pay Microsoft Advertising when someone clicks your ad.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your actual spend per day might be more or less than the actual target budget you've set. However, each month, you won't spend more than this number multiplied by the number of days in the month.
