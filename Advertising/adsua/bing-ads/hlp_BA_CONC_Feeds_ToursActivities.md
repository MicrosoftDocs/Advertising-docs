# Use Tours and activities ads to showcase specific tours and activities

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Showcase your tours and activities with these interactive, premium ad types, in which you can include images, current prices, reviews, and other relevant details. [!INCLUDE [NoCrawl](./includes/NoCrawl.md)] Instead, Tours and activities ads are dynamically generated based on the data you specify in your feed file, which contains your business data, such as the price, videos, and ratings. The more details you provide in the feed file, the more informative we’ll include in your ads. [!INCLUDE [TheMoreDetails](./includes/TheMoreDetails.md)]

## The benefits of using Tours and activities ads

## Get started

To get started with Tours and activities ads, you will need to create either an audience campaign or a search campaign. Both campaign types require creating a tours and activities feed file where you will reference the campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> Tours and activities ads are not available in shopping campaigns.

**Create an audience campaign**
An audience campaign requires you to have your dynamic feed ready to go before campaign creation. We’ll pull information from your feed to generate ad copy. Create a feed by uploading a [dynamic data feed file](./hlp_BA_CONC_FeedsAttributes_ToursActivities.md).

[!INCLUDE [CreateAudienceCampaign](./includes/CreateAudienceCampaign.md)]	**Create a search campaign**
A search campaign prompts you to create an expanded text ad. We’ll pull information from your feed file, such that the data in this feed file is used to generate ad copy and the settings in the expanded text ad are used for targeting and optimization.
