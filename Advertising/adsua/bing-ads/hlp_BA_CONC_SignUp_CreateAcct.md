# Signing up: Create your first Microsoft Advertising account

In Microsoft Advertising, sign up has three steps:

- Create your first account
- Import or create a campaign
- Set up your billing options

Once you've completed these three steps, your ads will be eligible to go live after [an editorial review](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditProcess.md). We recommend finishing all three steps, but during sign up, you only need to create an account. You can import or create campaigns and set up your billing options after sign up.

Also after sign up, you can create more accounts. You might want to create more accounts to help structure your campaigns. You'll need to do this if you are going to pay in more than one currency. Learn more about [the best way to structure your accounts and campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAccts.md).

## Decide how you want to sign in

When you go to [Microsoft Advertising sign-up](https://ads.microsoft.com/signup), you'll have two options:

## Use an existing email address to create an account
1. Go to the [Microsoft Advertising sign-up](https://ads.microsoft.com/signup) page and enter an existing email address (work, school, or personal email address from a service such as Outlook, Gmail, or Yahoo).
If you have an email address you already use to sign in to Microsoft products (like Skype or Xbox LIVE), all you need to do is sign in and the transition will be complete. If you've never used this email to sign in to a Microsoft product, you’ll be able to sign up for a new account.

1. Otherwise, click **Create one!** next to **No account?**, and then click **Next**.
1. In the following window, confirm that you want to create a new account and then click **Next**.
1. Create a password and click **Next**.
1. Enter your **First name** and **Last name**, and then click **Next**.
1. You'll need to enter the verification that Microsoft Advertising sent to the email address you provided. Check your email, enter the code in the prompt, and click **Next**.
1. Provide your **Company name** and **Business phone**. Please confirm your **Business location**, **Currency**, **Time zone**, and **Primary use** (if you're using the account to promote a business or if you're using an account on behalf of an ad agency).
1. Review the **Microsoft Advertising Terms and Conditions** and click the box if you agree to the terms. Then, click **Create account**.
1. After you’ve created your Microsoft Advertising account, you can set up your campaign by **              importing from Google Ads            ** or by **creating a new campaign**. You can also skip this step and click **Continue**.

You're now signed in to Microsoft Advertising!

Here are some things you might find useful when creating your first account:

- **Email.** This is the email address where you want to receive emails from Microsoft Advertising. You can use the same email address that you are using to sign in to Microsoft Advertising, or you can use a different one.
- **Country or region.** The country or region determines the language options available to you in sign up. It is typically the country or region where you manage your business. The country or region you select in sign up will not affect where your ads will run, what language the ads can be written in, the currency you pay in, or the time zone of your reports.
- **Language.** The language you select will affect the language that you see when you sign in to Microsoft Advertising and the emails that you receive from us. It does not affect the language of your ads.
- **Currency.** **Once you create an account, you cannot change the currency.** Choose your currency carefully because currency can affect your billing options. For a full list of payment methods you can use based on your country-currency combination, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).
- **Time zone.** This is the default time zone for your campaigns, and so we recommend that you use your local time zone. Time zone does not affect billing. All bills are based on Pacific Time.

## FAQ

## Why does Microsoft Advertising require customers to use an email address (Microsoft account) to sign in?
Using an email address (Microsoft account) to sign in offers two advantages:

- **Security.**  Microsoft account offers a two-step verification process that helps ensure the safety and integrity            of your Microsoft Advertising account. If you choose to use [Two-step verification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398313), you will be required to provide a security code, in addition to your email address and password,            when accessing your account from any device that hasn’t been previously authorized as a [trusted device](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398339).
- **Simplified sign in.**  Using one account to sign in to all your Microsoft products means you can get and stay           connected more easily.

## What is a Microsoft account?
"Microsoft account" is the new name for what used to be called "Windows Live ID." Your Microsoft account is the          combination of an email address and a password that you use to sign in to services or devices, such as Office365, Skype, Hotmail, Messenger,          OneDrive, Windows Phone, Xbox LIVE, or Outlook.com. If you use an email address and password to sign in to these or other          services, you already have a Microsoft account. Or if you prefer, you can create a new Microsoft account using any of your email addresses (for example, Gmail or Yahoo).
