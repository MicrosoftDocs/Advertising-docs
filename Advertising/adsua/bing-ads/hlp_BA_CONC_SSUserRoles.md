# How do I give someone access to my Microsoft Advertising account?

![Give someone access to your account](../images/BA_Conc_ShareAccount.svg)
Everyone who uses Microsoft Advertising is assigned a user role, which gives permissions to perform specific account functions. The person who signs up for    the account is given the role of Super Admin, which gives them full permissions, including inviting and deleting other users. If you have more than one    person accessing a Microsoft Advertising account, you'll want to know how to invite users and what role to give them.

## About user roles

Microsoft Advertising user roles are Super Admin, Standard User, Advertiser Campaign Manager, and Viewer.

Here are the roles in a nutshell:

- **Super Admin** . This role has full permissions for all accounts. A Super Admin can manage everything related to billing and payments, account details, and other users (including other Super Admins). The Super Admin can specify which accounts other users have access to. When signing up as a new customer, the first user is the Super Admin. Super Admins can also be set as the Primary Contact to an account.
- **Standard User** . This role has permissions to manage campaigns and perform some billing activities on selected accounts. This role cannot add, edit, or delete payment methods; create or delete accounts; or link to or unlink from clients. Standard Users can also be set as the Primary Contact to an account.

> [!NOTE]
> **Standard Users**  can now manage some users in the accounts they have access to. A Standard User can add or remove other Standard Users, Advertiser Campaign Managers, and Viewers. This new capability allows Standard Users to also view all the users in the **Users** tab. However, Standard Users cannot add or delete a Super Admin, nor can they edit a Super Admin's role.

- **Advertiser Campaign Manager** . This role has permissions to view selected accounts and add, edit, or delete campaigns within the selected accounts. The Super Admin can specify which accounts the Advertiser Campaign Manager has access to.  The Advertiser Campaign Manager can view payment methods, but cannot manage any billing or payment tasks.
- **Viewer** . This role has read-only permissions.

## About managing users

Only Super Admins can manage users in a Microsoft Advertising account. If you do not see the **User management** page within **Account access**, you are not a Super Admin. Most accounts can have as many as 15 users per account.

A best practice for user management is to ensure that each person signs in to Microsoft Advertising with their own user name and password.    Having separate user accounts is more secure and also has the benefit of letting you use    [change history](./hlp_BA_CONC_ChangeHistoryGraph.md) to review changes made by each user. For more information, see [Best practices to help protect your Microsoft Advertising account](./hlp_BA_CONC_SecurityBestPractices.md).

 
## Invite a new user
Shortly after you invite a new user, they will receive an account activation email with [            instructions on signing in to Microsoft Advertising          ](./hlp_BA_PROC_InviteNewUser.md). Only those with Super Admin and Standard User roles can invite new users.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickAccountaccessTab2](./includes/ClickAccountaccessTab2.md)]
1. Click **User Management** from the main menu.
1. Click **Invite user** from the **User Management** page.
1. Enter information about the new user and their account role.
1. Click **Send**.

> [!NOTE]
> The email address you enter to invite a new user is just for sending the invitation. The new user can sign in to Microsoft Advertising using a different email address.

## Change a Primary Contact
The Primary contact is the main contact for the account and will receive service communications and critical notifications (for example, campaign paused, prepay account balance low, and credit card expiration date approaching). Only Super Admins and Standard Users can be set as a Primary contact.

1. [!INCLUDE [PreferencesAccountSettings](./includes/PreferencesAccountSettings.md)]
1. Next to the **Account settings** page title, click the edit icon&nbsp;![Edit icon](../images/MC_EditMyAdvertisers_icon.png).
1. Next to the **Primary contact** list, select a user.

## Remove a user
Don’t forget to delete old users from your account. This prevents unauthorized people from accessing or changing your campaigns. Only those with Super Admin and Standard User roles can perform this task.

> [!NOTE]
> Before removing a Primary Contact from an account, you must designate a new Primary Contact for that account.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickAccountaccessTab2](./includes/ClickAccountaccessTab2.md)]
1. Click **User Management** in the main menu.
1. On the **User Management** page, find the tile of the person you want to remove, and click **delete**.

## What if you want an agency to manage your account?

If you want an agency to manage your account, we recommend that you set up a formal relationship with your agency in Microsoft Advertising, rather than creating a new user.    Read more about [agency-client relationships](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAgencyClientProcess.md).
