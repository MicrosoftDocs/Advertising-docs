Before you can track conversions or target audiences using a remarketing list, you need to create a UET tag in Microsoft Advertising and then add the UET tag tracking code to every page of your website. Don't know what UET is? See [What is UET and how can it help me?](./hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2WhatIsTag.md)

1. In the left navigation pane, click **Conversion Tracking** and then **UET tags** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** and then **UET tags**).
1. Click **Create UET tag** and then enter a name.
