# Pause or enable your campaigns

Whether you want to temporarily stop spending on your ads, or check your settings after a recent import into Microsoft Advertising, you can pause and enable your campaigns whenever you'd like.

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Campaigns** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Campaigns**).
1. In the Campaigns table, find the campaign that you want to pause or enable.
1. In the status column (the column to the left of the **Campaign** column), click the drop-down arrow near your campaign's status to pause or enable your campaign.
