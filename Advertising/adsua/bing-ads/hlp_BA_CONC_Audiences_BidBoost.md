# Set up bid boost

Once you create an audience and associate it with an ad group or campaign, you can then increase/decrease the bid amount, or bid boost, for it.

For example, you could increase your bids for shopping cart abandoners and reduce your bids for people that already made purchased your products.

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Audiences** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Audiences**).
1. Select the checkbox next to an audience.
1. Click **Edit** and then **Change bid adjustment**.
1. Select **Increase by** or **Decrease by** and enter the amount in percent.             You can increase the bid up to 900% and decrease by 90%.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Advertising won't apply any bid boosts until the associated audiences have at least 1000 users.
> Bid adjustments don't apply to an excluded audience association.
> By default, bid adjustments of 15% will be applied to new targeting associations. Existing associations in the ad groups or campaigns will not be changed.
