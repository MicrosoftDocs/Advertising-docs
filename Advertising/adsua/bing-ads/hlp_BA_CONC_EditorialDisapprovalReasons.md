# How do I fix a Disapproved or Approved Limited status?

As part of the [editorial review](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditProcess.md) process, the components of your ad are reviewed to ensure that they meet [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md). Ad components that don't pass the review process receive either Disapproved or Approved Limited status.

Here’s what you can do about it:

## Determine the specific reason for the **Disapproved** or **Approved Limited** status
1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Ads**, **Keywords**, or **Ad Extensions** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then either **Ads &amp; extensions** or **Keywords**).
1. Find the delivery status of your ad components in the **Delivery** column. (You can sort the **Delivery** column to more easily find the **Disapproved** or **Approved Limited** items by clicking the **Delivery** column header.)
1. Click the ellipsis icon ![More information icon](../images/BA_ScreenCap_DeliveryDetails.png) next to (or hover over) the status in the **Delivery** column to see the ad component's disapproved terms and the reasons for the disapprovals.
1. If the status is **Approved Limited**, you will also see the specific market(s) in which the ad component is disapproved. This ad component is not functional in the listed market(s), but it is functional in all other targeted locations. For more information on **Approved Limited**, see [What does Approved Limited status mean?](./hlp_BA_CONC_ApprovedLimited.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Did you receive an email saying that you had a **Disapproved** or **Approved Limited** ad or keyword, but you took the above steps and don't see any ad or keyword listed as such? One of two things may have happened:
> 
> - Your ad or keyword may have been pending review in one or more of your targeted locations (**Approved Limited** status), and by the time you followed these steps, it was approved.
> - The Microsoft Advertising team regularly performs spot checks on its editorial rejections, and occasionally overturns rejections. Your ad or keyword may have been **Disapproved** at first, but then was approved after being spot checked.

## Consult Microsoft Advertising policies
Review the [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md) related to the **Disapproved reasons** for your ad components (see above). Note that the policies may vary depending on the country/region in which the ad is displayed.

## Fix the issue
|Disapproved ads|
|---|
|From the **Ads** table, hover over the ad in the **Ad** column and click the pencil icon. Make any necessary edits and click **Save**. We will perform a new editorial review on the updated ad.|
|Disapproved keywords|
|You cannot edit a keyword. However, you can add a new keyword and then delete the disapproved keyword. If you add a new keyword, it will be submitted for editorial review when you click **Save**.|
|Disapproved ad extensions|
|From the **Ad Extensions** table, select the ad extension and then click **Edit** &nbsp; &gt; &nbsp; **Edit an extension**. Make any necessary edits and click **Save**. We will perform a new editorial review on the updated content.|
|Disapproved feed items|
|Fix the issue in your feed and re-upload it, as described in [Setting up and managing feeds](./hlp_BA_PROC_Feeds_WorkingWith.md).|

## Request an exception
If, after reviewing the [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md), you believe you were disapproved in error, you can request an exception. With the request, you tell us the reason you want an exception and we will review the ad component again.

<table type="type1">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Ads and keywords</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <para>
        <ol>
          <li>
						In the <strong>Ads</strong> or <strong>Keywords</strong> table, select the checkbox to the left of the affected ad or keyword.
					  </li>
          <li>
						Select <strong>Edit</strong> &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <strong>Request exception</strong>.
					  </li>
          <li>
						In the <strong>Tell us your reason for requesting an exception</strong> box, enter your reasons why the ad or keyword should be approved.
					  </li>
          <li>
						Click <strong>Request an exception</strong>.
					  </li>
        </ol>
      </para>
    </td>
  </tr>

    <th scope="col">Ad extensions and ad customizers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
					  Please [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to request an exception.

  </tr>

## My ad was disapproved, but I see other ads with the same issues. Why?
We have many checks in place to identify and remove content that violates Microsoft Advertising policies. If there is content on our network that is in violation of our policies, it’s simply a matter of time before it is found and removed.

If you find content on our network that you believe is in violation of Microsoft Advertising policies, please report it to us through our [Report Low Quality Ad form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398370). We will review the ad and take action if it violates our policies.
