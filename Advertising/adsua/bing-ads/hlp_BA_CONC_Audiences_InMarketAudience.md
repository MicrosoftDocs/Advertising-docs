# In-market audiences: Reach people who are ready to buy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.

In-market audiences are curated lists of customers who have shown purchase intent signals within a particular category, including searches and clicks on Bing and page views on Microsoft services. Microsoft Advertising supplies the curated list of potential customers, unlike remarketing in paid search, where the advertiser creates the list. You can target and modify bids for these audiences by associating in-market audience lists to ad groups or campaigns, similar to what you do with remarketing lists.

## Why use in-market audiences?

**Increase conversions** . Reach curated audiences that are more likely to convert in your category.

**Improve bids and targeting** . Set up your ad group or campaign to be exclusive to an audience with an in-market audience or available to everyone, but with a bid adjustment for your targeted audience.

**Simple set-up** . In-market audiences are simple to set up and don’t require UET tags.

## FAQs
**Who should use in-market audiences?**                      Businesses large and small can benefit from using in-market audiences. If you have customers who are represented in one of the in-market audiences, you should use this feature to reach more potential customers. For example, an auto business should associate ad groups or campaigns to the "Vehicles/Motor Vehicles/Cars &amp; Trucks" in-market audience.

**Who shouldn't use in-market audiences?**                      If you don’t have customers in one of the available in-market audience categories listed, you shouldn’t use this feature, as you’d be extending your reach to the wrong audience.

**Are additional in-market audiences going to be released?**                      Yes. Additional in-market audiences will be released soon and Microsoft Advertising will continue to evaluate additional in-market audiences.

**What campaign and ad types do in-market audiences work with?**                      In-market audiences work with all campaign and ad types, including dynamic search ads and Microsoft Shopping Campaigns. (While in-market audiences are not specifically optimized for Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, you can associate in-market audiences to shopping campaigns and monitor their performance.)

**Can I use in-market audiences in my campaigns that run across all device types?**                      Yes. In-market audiences can be associated to ad groups or campaigns for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

**Can I use in-market audiences in my campaigns that run across the entire Microsoft Search Network, including syndicated partners?**                      No, in-market audiences are only supported on sites owned and operated by Bing, AOL, and Yahoo.

**Are exclusions allowed for in-market audiences?**                      Yes. Exclusions can be used for in-market audiences and all audience targeting offerings.

**How do I edit the targeting setting for an association?**                          The targeting setting can be edited one ad group or campaign at a time from the **Audiences** page by clicking on **Create association** and then selecting the relevant ad group or campaign. The updated targeting setting is applied to all the associations of that ad group or campaign. If you want to do this in bulk for multiple ad groups or campaigns, please use [Microsoft Advertising Editor](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutDesktop.md). [Learn more about editing the targeting setting for an association](./hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_TargetSettings.md).

**Can I use a "Target and bid" setting for one audience list and a "Bid only" setting for another audience list in the same ad group or campaign?**              			No, you can only select one targeting setting per ad group or campaign that will apply to all your audience lists in that ad group or campaign (either "Target and bid" or "Bid only"). It isn't possible to use different targeting settings in the same ad group or campaign for remarketing lists, in-market audiences, and custom audiences. Whichever setting you've selected most recently ("Target and bid" or "Bid only") overrides any previous settings.

**Does enhanced CPC (auto-bidding) work with in-market audiences?**                      Yes. Enhanced CPC works with in-market audiences.

**How should I use in-market audiences with remarketing?**                      Use in-market audiences with remarketing to reach even more potential customers. Remarketing focuses on customers who have previously interacted with your website, while in-market audiences helps to acquire new customers and grow your remarketing lists.

**How should I evaluate in-market audience performance?**                      We recommend you run one campaign with no audience targeting and run the same campaign with in-market audiences associated. This will help you understand how audience targeting can help to optimize your campaign performance.

**How many in-market audience associations can I have?**            		  Take a look at the table in [What are my options for audiences?](./hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_Options.md)

**What is the ad delivery behavior when multiple audiences are associated with the same ad group or campaign?**                      If multiple audiences (for example, remarketing list and in-market audience) are associated with the same ad group or campaign and a user qualifies to be part of those multiple audiences, the audience with the highest bid will be applied.
