# Combine similar bills into a single invoice (consolidated billing)

If you have more than one invoiced account, consolidated billing allows you to combine multiple bills into a single invoice, making it faster and simpler for you to review your billing across your accounts. But don't think that streamlining your paperwork means that you won't have access to the data you need. The billing details for each of your accounts are always available in the Billing tab.

## Some things to know about consolidated billing

- Consolidated billing is only an option for customers who receive monthly invoices.
- Monthly invoices eligible for consolidation must share the same characteristics, such as the same Microsoft Advertising manager account number, currency, language, and SAP ID.
- Only users with Super Admin permissions can sign up for consolidated billing.
- You can't select specific accounts for consolidated billing. Consolidated billing applies to all of your accounts or none of them.
