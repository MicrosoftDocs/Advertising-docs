# Microsoft Advertising promotional offer - Definition

## What it is

Microsoft Advertising often runs promotions for new customers, so that they can try out online advertising with us.

## How it works

If you sign up as part of a promotion and qualify, you'll receive a promotional code through email. (Check your junk mail folder if you don't see the email.) You redeem your code in Microsoft Advertising. Then, we apply a credit to your account with a promotional balance if you meet requirements, such as a minimum spend amount.

## What you need to know

- Coupons can only be used to pay for future advertising costs. If you have an account balance, the coupon cannot be used to pay off your balance.
- Coupons have expiration dates and come with certain requirements.
- Coupons are sent within 3 days of account setup.
