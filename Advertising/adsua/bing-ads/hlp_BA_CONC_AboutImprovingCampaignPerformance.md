# How do I improve my ad campaign performance?

You've gained valuable insights from tracking click-through rate (CTR), average ad position, cost per click (CPC), conversions, and conversion rate from the Campaigns page tabs or [performance reports](./hlp_BA_PROC_CreateReport.md). Here are some ways to use that information to improve the freshness, relevance, and performance of your campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to a couple of weeks for results from your changes to start showing up. So it's a good idea to regularly run performance reports every two to four weeks.

This can help lower CPC, and can also increase the click-through rate and conversions.</li><li>Use targeting appropriately, especially [targeting by location](./hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md), to help reduce clicks from people who aren't likely customers.</li></ul></para>
