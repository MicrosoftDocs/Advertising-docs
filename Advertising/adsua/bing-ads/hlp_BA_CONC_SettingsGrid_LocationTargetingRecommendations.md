With inline location targeting recommendations, Microsoft Advertising suggests new areas to target and shows you their estimated impact, all without having to leave the Settings tab. These recommendations highlight the estimated increase in impressions and search volume you could see by targeting new locations. Recommendations can also be found within detailed maps making it even clearer which areas to target.

## Understanding your metrics
**Impressions:**              Impressions are the number of times an ad has been displayed on search results pages on the Microsoft Search Network or on sites in the Microsoft Audience Network. We will highlight the impressions you could get by targeting new locations.

**Search volume:**          Search volume is the number of times over the last 7-day period that the list of keywords associated with a product or individual keywords were searched. The higher your search volume, the better chances potential customers could see your ads in the areas you’re targeting.

## How to apply inline location targeting recommendations
1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click **Settings**.
1. In the **Locations** column for the campaign you want to optimize, click the Recommendation icon ![recommendation icon](../images/BA_Icon_BulbBlue.png).
