# How do I delete my account?

Was it something we did â€” or didn't do? Breaking up is hard. Phone us and [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to discuss your concerns and talk about your options. We can coach you through performance issues and you can get tips on best practices to getting your ads in front of the right customers. Or, if you wish, we can help you deactivate your account.

## Troubleshooting performance issues

Before you delete your Microsoft Advertising account, consider these solutions as well:

Deleting an account makes it "inactive." While inactive accounts can be reactivated by Support, you should only delete an account    if you have no plans to use it in the future. If you anticipate using your Microsoft Advertising account again, you should simply [pause your campaigns](./hlp_BA_PROC_PauseEnableCampaign.md), which will stop your ads from running and charges from accumulating.
