# How do I delete my account?

Was it something we did â€” or didn't do? Breaking up is hard. So, phone us and [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to talk about your concerns and your options. We can coach you through performance issues. You can get tips and best practices on getting your ads in front of the right customers. Or, if you wish, we can help you deactivate your account.

Before you delete your Microsoft Advertising account, consider these solutions as well.

Deleting an account makes it "inactive." Although inactive accounts can be reactivated by Support, you should only delete an account    if you have no plans to use it in the future. If you anticipate using your Microsoft Advertising account again, you should simply [pause your campaigns](./hlp_BA_PROC_PauseEnableCampaign.md), which will stop your ads from running and charges from accumulating.

## How to delete an account
1. On the **Campaigns** page, click the **Campaigns** tab.
1. Select all campaigns, click **Edit**, and then click **Pause**.
1. [!INCLUDE [ClickAccountsBillingTab](./includes/ClickAccountsBillingTab.md)]
1. Click the **Billing** tab, and then click **Pay account balance**.
1. Click the **Accounts** tab.
1. Select the accounts you want to delete, and click **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> - You can still sign in to a deleted account so that you can reference account information.
> - If you have no outstanding charges and have remaining funds on your account, then you're entitled to a refund. See [About credits, refunds, and adjustments](./hlp_BA_CONC_CreditsRefunds.md) for more information.
