# What is auto-recharge and how does it work?

With auto-recharge, you can help make sure that your prepay account has enough balance remaining to keep your ads running. If you don't set up auto-recharge and your balance remaining hits zero, we'll pause your campaigns and your ads will not display until you [manually add more funds](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md).

## How does auto-recharge work?

If you sign up for auto-recharge, each time your account balance reaches 20 percent of the recharge amount, we will automatically charge your primary payment method and add funds to your account.
