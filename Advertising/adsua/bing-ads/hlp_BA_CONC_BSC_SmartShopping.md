Automatically optimize your shopping campaigns to target customers who are more likely to convert at higher revenue values with smart shopping campaigns. By using a combination of traditional shopping campaigns, automated bidding and targeting, smart shopping helps you get the right ad to the right user, at the right time – at scale!

Setting your business goals and targets provides context to automatically adjust bids and shopping ads delivery to help optimize your campaigns. This, in turn, can help increase revenue and meet return on ad spend (ROAS) targets.

## Why use smart shopping campaigns

**Reach customers who will likely covert at higher revenue values**  Smart shopping campaigns use Maximize Conversion Value (where Microsoft Advertising automatically sets your bids in real time to maximize total conversion value within your budget) and automated targeting to maximize overall revenue numbers with an option to define ROAS targets.

**Optimize with automated campaigns**  Smart shopping campaigns automate bids and ads delivery based on customer signals to help create a more personalized shopping experience.

**Simplify campaign creation and management**  To get started with a shopping campaign, you just need your product feed, a UET tag, and your business goals. Once you have that, you only need to set your budget and targeting options to start optimizing your shopping campaigns.

## Before getting started...

1. Create and add a UET tag to your website. The additional code needed to track variable revenue data is required for smart shopping campaigns, so be sure to have it created and added to your website before you begin creating your smart shopping campaign. Note: Because variable revenue is required, a destination URL or event conversion goal is also required. [Learn more about how to create and add a UET tag](./hlp_BA_CONC_UET_Setup_Master.md).
1. Submit your product feed to MMC or use your existing feed. Be sure send updated data at least every 30 days. [Learn more about feed files](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBingMerchantCenterCatalogFile.md).
