# Use Automotive ads to showcase your models and inventory

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in an open beta for the US and UK.

Showcase real-time inventory of new and used cars to nearby shoppers who are in the comparison and transaction stages. [!INCLUDE [NoCrawl](./includes/NoCrawl.md)] Instead, Automotive ads are dynamically generated based on the data you specify in your feed file, which contains business data such as vehicle photos, special prices, and other relevant details. From third-party sites and auto dealers displaying their new and used inventory to automotive manufacturers advertising their new models, Automotive ads drive performance.

## The benefits of using Automotive ads

[!INCLUDE [BenefitsOfDynamicDataFeeds](./includes/BenefitsOfDynamicDataFeeds.md)]
## Get started

To get started with Automotive ads, you will need to create either an audience campaign or a search campaign. Both campaign types require creating an autos feed file where you will reference the campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> Automotive ads are not available in shopping campaigns.

**Create an audience campaign**
An audience campaign requires you to have your dynamic feed ready to go before campaign creation. We’ll pull information from your feed to generate ad copy. Create a feed by uploading a [dynamic data feed file](./hlp_BA_CONC_FeedsAttributes_Autos.md).

[!INCLUDE [CreateAudienceCampaign](./includes/CreateAudienceCampaign.md)]**Create a search campaign**
A search campaign prompts you to create an expanded text ad. We’ll pull information from your feed file, such that the data in this feed file is used to generate ad copy and the settings in the expanded text ad are used for targeting and optimization.

[!INCLUDE [CreateSearchCampaign](./includes/CreateSearchCampaign.md)]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In **Campaign settings**, you have the option to select the checkbox next to **Disclaimer**. [Disclaimer in ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_Feeds_DisclaimerInAds.md) is not required for Automotive ads, but you can use it to add any disclaimers. The campaign creation process is the only time to enable this option.
> Note: If you opt to enable Disclaimer in ads, you are only creating a placeholder now, which will soon be put into use.
