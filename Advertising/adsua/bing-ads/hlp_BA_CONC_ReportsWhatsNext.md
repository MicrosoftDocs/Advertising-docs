# More ways to track and improve campaign performance

Once you have some experience [using performance reports and optimizing your campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutImprovingCampaignPerformance.md) and landing pages, consider trying some more specialized techniques and features. Here some suggestions for keeping your campaigns in tune, performing well, and producing the ROI you want to see.

## Track keyword quality score
**Why:** Quality score indicates how relevant your keywords are to people's search queries or other input, and how competitive your ads and campaigns are over time. A low quality score means your ads are less likely to appear on the Microsoft Search Network when a keyword is matched.

**How:** Add [quality score and historic quality score](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutQualityScore.md) to your keyword performance reports. Use this information to optimize your keywords, ads, and landing pages.

## Use the Top vs. other column to help improve your ad position
**Why:** More people are likely to see your ad if it's in a top, or mainline, position (ad positions 1-4) rather than on the bottom or sidebar (ad positions 5-8) of the search results page.

**How:** Include the **Top vs. other** attribute column when you run account, campaign, ad group, ad, and keyword [performance reports](./hlp_BA_PROC_CreateReport.md) to:

- Learn where your ad is displayed on the Microsoft Search Network.
- Compare the cost per click (CPC) and click-through rate (CTR) between ads in the mainline and bottom or sidebar ad positions. Then optimize keyword bids as needed to improve ad position and campaign performance

## Use the Keyword suggestions feature on the Recommendations tab
