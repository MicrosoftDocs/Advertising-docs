# About the Competition tab

What are your competitors up to and how do they compare to you? The Competition tab is your one-stop shop to gather valuable information about your competition in Microsoft Advertising. Along with insights, we'll recommend actions you can take to get ahead of the pack.

## Auction Insights

Auction Insights give you a broad view into your competitorsâ€™ performance metrics and how they compare to your own. Reviewing them can give you a better understanding of your competitive landscape. Auction Insights are divided into two sections.

**Over time:**    View key competitive metrics and how they perform across devices and over the course of days, weeks, months, quarters, and years.

**Summary:**    See aggregated metrics for a specific date range. You can segment these metrics by hour of the day, day of the week, and device type.

## Deeper insights and actions

Using machine learning, Microsoft Advertising finds where you can make adjustments to your campaigns to stay ahead of the competition.

**The recommendation:**  AI-powered suggestions for a specific campaign, ad group, keyword, location, or device type.

** What's happening:**    How campaigns, ad groups, keywords, locations, and device types stack up against your competition right now.

**What you can do:**    Specific actions to take based on the findings.

**Changes you could see:** The estimated benefits you might see after applying recommendations.
