# What is "ad position"?

**Ad position** is the position of your ad on a Bing, AOL, or Yahoo search results page. It's determined by how your ad ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by many factors, including:

- The amount you bid for your keyword. For more info, see [What are keyword bids](./hlp_BA_CONC_NewAd_SetCampaignBudgetAndBidAmounts.md).
- Your ad's relevance.
- Your ad's performance, based on various response signals — for example, click-through rate (CTR).

Since webpages have a limited number of spaces to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads in those spaces. So, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword "shoe," you’ll have to beat the bids of the other shoe sellers who are also bidding on "shoe." If your bid is not high enough, you might not get the space you want, such as on the first page of search results.

This data shows which keywords cause your ads to appear in the mainline (top) or sidebar or bottom of the page (other) position on search result pages. For example, to appear at the top of the ad results on Bing.com in position 1,2,3, or 4, (also called the **mainline**), your ad must meet a minimum level of performance. If the ad doesn’t meet that minimum level, it can appear on the right side of the page (also called the **sidebar**) or at the bottom of the page. There’s nothing wrong with appearing on the sidebar or at the bottom of the page, but most advertisers strive to get one of those coveted mainline spots. (In some markets, the top ads are repeated at the bottom of the web page at no additional cost). For suggestions on how to improve your ad position, see [Get my ad to the top of the search results page](./hlp_BA_CONC_ImproveAdPosition.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Text ads no longer serve in the sidebar on Bing owned and operated sites in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, or Australia.
> Microsoft Advertising will not show multiple ads from the same domain or with similar landing pages on the same page at the same time. If more than one ad with the same domain or landing page is eligible for a given query, the ad rank will determine which ad is shown.

You can run an account, campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword performance report and select the **Top vs. other** column to see performance differences (such as CPC and CTR) between mainline and sidebar ads. This can help you optimize your keyword bids to improve performance and increase your ROI. Please note that when reviewing the **Top vs. other** column in Reports, sidebar ads and ads at the bottom of the page are both listed as “other” ads. For info on running a performance report, see [Create a report](./hlp_BA_PROC_CreateReport.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Top vs. other position information is not available for dates prior to March 14, 2013.
> Microsoft Shopping Campaigns are not factored into the calculation for average position. The average position for these types of campaigns, ad groups, and ads will show up as 0.
