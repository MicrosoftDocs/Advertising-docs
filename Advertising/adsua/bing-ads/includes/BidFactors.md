- **Your bid on a keyword or placement.** Your keyword or placement bid is the maximum amount you can be charged when your ad is clicked. Learn more about bidding in [Set your campaign budget and bid amounts](../hlp_BA_CONC_NewAd_SetCampaignBudgetAndBidAmounts.md).
- ** Incremental bids to target customers by time of day, gender, or other targeting criteria. **         When one or more of your target criteria is met and your ad is clicked, you also pay the amount of your corresponding incremental bids. Thus incremental bids can increase the cost of your default and custom bids. Learn about targeting and incremental bids in [How to target my customers by adjusting my bids](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md).
