**Note:**  If you unlink the bill-to customer responsible for billing, you'll automatically become the bill-to customer unless someone else is already queued up to take over billing. Also, postpay threshold and monthly invoice accounts will be paused for up to 3 hours when a bill-to customer is unlinked. No ads will serve while outstanding charges are settled.
