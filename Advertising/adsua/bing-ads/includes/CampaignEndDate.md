The campaign end date is the final closing date of an ad group that's part of the campaign. The campaign will run for as long as any ad group within it is running. If the campaign includes an ad group whose end date setting is **No end date**, the campaign will run indefinitely. You can change the end date for any ad group in a campaign.
