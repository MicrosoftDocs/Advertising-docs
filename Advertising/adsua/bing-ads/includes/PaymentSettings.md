There are three payment settings.

- **Prepay.**  You pay in advance for your ads. As your ads are clicked, we'll deduct money from your account balance. When your account balance gets low, you can make another prepayment to keep your ads running.
- **Postpay threshold.**  You pay after your ads are clicked. You'll automatically pay at the end of your monthly billing cycle or when you reach your threshold, whichever comes first. Thresholds start low (for example, $50 USD) and grow over time.
- **Monthly invoice.**  You accrue advertising charges, and then we send you a bill at the end of your billing cycle every month. This option is only available to those who pass a credit check and meet certain qualifications. If you don't see this option listed here      and you are interested in finding out whether you qualify, you can [learn more and apply here](../hlp_BA_PROC_MonthlyInvoiceApply.md).
