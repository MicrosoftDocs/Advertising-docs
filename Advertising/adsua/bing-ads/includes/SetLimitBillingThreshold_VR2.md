> [!NOTE]
> Charges can exceed the billing threshold or your limit by a small amount. If you are setting the limit to avoid reaching a maximum amount that you can charge on your credit card, you might want to set your limit slightly below that amount.
> It will take about an hour for your new limit to be saved in our system.
> If you set your limit below your current balance, we will charge you the full balance. After that, you will be charged your limit (or a slightly larger amount). If you need to reduce your balance before you set your limit, you can[ pay your account balance](../hlp_BA_PROC_MakePayment.md).
> If you change your postpay payment option from threshold to monthly invoice, we will remove the billing threshold limit.
