1. [!INCLUDE [ClickAccountsBillingTab](./ClickAccountsBillingTab.md)]
1. Select the **Billing** tab.
1. If you have more than one account, select the account number for the account you want to set the limit on.
1. In the **When you pay** summary at the top of the page, select **set a limit**.
1. Select **Limit each charge to** and enter the payment amount you do not want to exceed.

**Keep in mind**

- Charges can exceed the billing threshold or your limit by a small amount. If you are setting the limit to avoid reaching a maximum amount			that you can charge on your credit card, you might want to set your limit slightly below that amount.
- It will take about an hour for your new limit to be saved in our system.
- If you set your limit below your current balance, we will charge you the full balance. After that, you will be charged your limit (or a slightly larger amount). If you need to reduce your balance before you set your limit, you can [pay your account balance](../hlp_BA_PROC_MakePayment.md).
- If you change your postpay payment option from threshold to monthly invoice, we will remove the billing threshold limit.
