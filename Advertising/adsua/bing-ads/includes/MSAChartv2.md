            You can merge two user names by entering the existing work, school, or personal email address or the Microsoft account you want to use to sign in. However, if you have more than two Microsoft Advertising user names, you will need to contact your account manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to add multi-user access to your user name.

            As a [security best practice](../hlp_BA_CONC_SecurityBestPractices.md), we do not recommend sharing a single email address and password among a group of people. Instead the Super Admin should transition first and then invite other users, who will each need to sign up with new email addresses and passwords. [Learn more](../hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)</para>
