**Active:** Your promotional offer is successfully redeemed, and you can track your credit balance or the amount of money you need to spend to receive your credit. You can't have two active offers at one time.

**Expired:** The offer has expired and is no longer valid.

**Depleted:** You have exhausted your promotional credit.

**Needs payment method:** You must have a payment method on file to redeem a promotional offer. For a limited-time offer, you'll see this status along with the cutoff date to add a payment method. The status will switch to "Active" once you add a valid payment method.

**Pending:** If you have two valid offers, one offer will be pending (on hold) while the other is active. After the active offer is expired or depleted, the pending offer will become active.
