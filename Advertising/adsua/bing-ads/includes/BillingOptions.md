**What it is:**      Billing options include how you pay (payment setting) and what you pay with (payment method).

**What you need to know:**  To see your payment method options, select a payment setting (postpay or prepay).

- **Postpay**  You identify the payment method you want to use to pay for clicks on your ad, and we charge that payment method on a regular basis (monthly or when you reach your billing threshold, whichever comes first).
- **Prepay**  You add funds to your account and charges are deducted after your ads are clicked. When your account balance gets low, you add more funds, either [manually or automatically](../hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md).
