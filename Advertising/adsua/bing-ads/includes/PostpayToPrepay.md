When we switch you from postpay to prepay, we need to settle your postpay account charges if you have a balance. To do this, we charge your payment method when you select Submit on the Make the Switch step. If  your ads receive clicks after you select Submit and before we switch you to prepay, you will see another small charge on your payment method to cover those additional clicks.
