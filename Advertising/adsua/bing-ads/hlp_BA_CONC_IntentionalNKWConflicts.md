# Understanding negative keyword conflicts and their reports

You can use [negative keywords](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutNegativeKeywords.md) to help prevent your ads from being displayed to customers who are unlikely to click them. However, if you choose a negative keyword that is identical to an existing keyword, it will result in a conflict.

Possible conflict types are:

**        Possibly intentional:      **      Some advertisers **intentionally** create negative keyword conflicts to block a portion of match types from triggering your ads.  For example, if your phrase match keyword is “stereo plug”, you might also choose “stereo plug” as your exact match negative keyword text to match only with this phrase. In this scenario, customers that are searching for specific items like “3.5mm stereo plug” or “gold stereo plug” are more likely to see your ad.

If you intentionally created this conflict to block certain match types from triggering your ads, no action may be required.

- **True:**      Any other negative keyword conflict. This conflict can be resolved by deleting the conflicting negative keyword.
