# Auto-apply recommendation settings

> [!NOTE]
> All recommendation types might not be available for auto-apply just yet. More recommendation types will be available for auto-apply soon.

You can opt in to allow Microsoft Advertising to automatically create and apply more ad variations where they're needed, such as in ad groups that are underperforming. While you’ll still have the option to review, edit, apply, or dismiss any ad suggestion within the review period, Microsoft Advertising can also handle the process with no attention or action from you. If you don’t take action, we’ll automatically apply them after the review period:

- **Multimedia ads:**  7 days
- **All other ads:**  14 days

You have control over which recommendations are auto-applied to your account. Auto-apply recommendations work for the following types of recommendations:

- **Repairs.**  To fix your conversion goal settings.
- **Keyword &amp; targeting.**  Create dynamic search ads, remove negative keywords conflicts, and add new keywords, broad match keywords, and trending queries as keywords.
- **Ads &amp; extensions.**  Add responsive search ads, multimedia ads, and ad suggestions.

[Learn more about different types of recommendations](./hlp_BA_CONC_Recommendations.md).

## Change your auto-apply recommendation settings

**Opt in to auto-apply recommendations**
Opting in to auto-apply recommendations means that all of your ad groups are watched for areas with potential performance improvement. Keep in mind that each set of suggested ads might be intended for different ad groups.

When you opt in, we’ll notify you when the recommendations become available so you can review, edit, apply, or dismiss them. After the review period, recommendations will be automatically applied to your account.

1. [!INCLUDE [AllCampaignsRecommendations](./includes/AllCampaignsRecommendations.md)]
1. Select the **Auto-apply recommendation setting** (lightning bolt icon).
1. Select the checkbox next to the recommendation type you’d like to set to auto-apply for your account.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectSave](./includes/SelectSave.md)]

**Opt out of auto-apply recommendations**
You can change your auto-apply settings at any time. Note that if you don’t opt in, we may still generate recommendations that you can manually apply.

1. [!INCLUDE [SettingsAccountSettings](./includes/SettingsAccountSettings.md)]
1. Under **Auto-apply recommendations**, select the checkbox next to the ad types you would like to be automatically applied to your account. Uncheck the box next to any ad type that you want to opt out of auto-apply.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectSave](./includes/SelectSave.md)]

## Turn on auto-apply email notifications

When new recommendations are ready for review, we’ll always display a notification when you log in to Microsoft Advertising. You can also check the **Recommendations** tab to review a summary of all recommendations. Additionally, if you’d like to receive emails when new recommendations are available, be sure to select **Ad performance optimization** in your [email preferences](./hlp_BA_PROC_EmailNotifications.md).

## Track auto-apply recommendation history

You can track which recommendations are added in the **Account Change** history tab or the **History** tab within the **Recommendations** tab. On the **Account Change** history tab, you can see up to six months of applied history. On the **History** tab, you can see how many recommendations have been applied in the last 30 days.
