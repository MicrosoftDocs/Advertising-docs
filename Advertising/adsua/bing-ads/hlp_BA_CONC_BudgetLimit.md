# What if I reach my daily budget limit?

If you reach your daily limit, all ad groups in the campaign are paused. Here are the details:

**Daily - Standard** : This budget will be used by this campaign only.

- **Shared - Standard** : You have selected a shared budget from the Shared Library. This campaign will draw from the same budget as the other campaigns using this shared budget.

It's important to note that your daily limit is a target -- your actual spend might be higher or lower. Variations are caused by a number of factors, such as different traffic volumes in different days of the week, or automatic detection and refunding of fraud clicks that can give money back to a campaign within a few hours of the click. Microsoft Advertising anticipates and automatically compensates for the fluctuations, and usually keeps overspend to less than 100% above your daily limit.

If you don't take action to resume the campaign in **Budget paused** status, the campaign automatically restarts at the beginning of the next month.
