# What changes were made to my campaigns and can I undo them?

Have you ever wanted to go back in time to stop yourself from making a change to your campaigns, ad groups, ads or keywords? Do you wonder if the decrease in selects was caused by a certain change?

With change history, you can see each action made to your campaigns in the last six months and compare that to the changes in key performance metrics, like selects or impressions.   If you find a change that was made in the last 30 days that you wish you didn't make and it meets the eligibility requirements, you can undo that change.

Changes to campaigns, ad groups, ads and keywords that are eligible to be undone have an arrow button in the Undo column. Only changes made in the last 30 days can be undone. If a change can't be undone, the column will be empty.

The changes that can be undone are:

- **Campaigns: **  Bidding scheme, Budget amount, Budget type, Name, Status (Note: Undoing the deletion of a campaign will set your campaign back to its original status â€“ active or paused), Tracking template.
- **Ad groups: **  Bid (Search/Content), Bidding scheme, Name, Status, and Tracking template.
- **Ads: **  Ad title, Ad text, Display URL, Final URL, and Status.
- **Keywords: **  Bid, Bidding scheme, Final URL, Match type, Mobile final URL, Param1, Param2, Param3, and Status.
- **Standard text ads: **      Status
- **Expanded Text ads: **  Bidding scheme, Description, Final URL, Mobile final URL, Path 1, Path 2, Status, Title part 1, Title part 2, and Tracking template.
- **Dynamic Search Ads: **  Description, Path 1, Path 2, Status and Tracking template.
- **Audience Ads: **  Business name, Description, Final URL, Landscape Image, Landscape logo, Long headline, Mobile final URL, Short headline, Status, Square image, Square logo, Title, and Tracking template.
- **App Install Ads: **  Description, Final URL, Status, Tracking template, and Title.

## Find and undo changes
The change history tab lists every change made in the last six months, including system-generated changes. Use the date range, left panel, and filtering to narrow down the table.

1. Select **Campaigns** located at the top of the page and then select the **Change History** tab (or from the main menu on the far left, select **All campaigns** and then from the page menu, select **Change history**).
1. If you want to see changes to a specific campaign, in the left panel, select the one you want.
1. At the top right of the page, select the date range you want to review.
1. To show changes made by a specific person in the summary table, on the **Changed by** menu, select the user you want.
1. To show specific types of changes in the table, next to **Change type**, select the ones you want and select **Apply**.
1. Select **Show all details** to see all changes in the table.
1. If you can undo the change, in the **Undo** column, select the **arrow**.
1. In the undo dialog, select **Undo**.
1. In the verification dialog, select **Close**.
1. The **Change** column shows that the change was undone.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrator will show in the **Date &amp; Time/User** column when Microsoft Advertising completes a system-generated change. For example, Microsoft Advertising automatically pauses your campaign when your budget is depleted and then activates the campaign when the budget is replenished.
> The graph can display up to 200,000 changes. Narrow your results by selecting different change types, a shorter date range, or specific campaigns or ad groups.
> It can take time for the summary table to show that the change was undone.
> In a rare circumstance, we might not be able to undo the change even if you selected the arrow button because an action associated with the change has already been deleted. We will let you know if we can't undo the change.

## Use the graph to see the relationship between change history and key performance metrics

1. Select **Campaigns** located at the top of the page and select the **Change History** tab. (Or from the main menu on the far left, select **All campaigns**. Then from the page menu, select **Change history**.)
1. If the graph is closed, select the **show graph** toggle to open it. It remains open until you close it.
1. Select the metrics you want to see on the top right of the graph. Each metric is a different color line.
1. Select the time period on the top right of the graph.
1. To see the number of changes made on a specific date, hover over a change history marker on the line.
1. To filter what changes you see in the table, select a change history marker in the graph.

## Don't see any changes?
- **Check your date range.** If you have **Today** as your date range, there is a good chance that no changes have happened yet.
- **Give it some time.** Changes you have just made take a few minutes before they show on the Change History tab. Wait a few minutes and select the Change History tab again.
- **Check your filters.** Make sure that the **Change types** and **Changed by** filters are set to what you are looking for.
