# What can I do with labels?

Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on whatever is important to you. You can then filter and run reports on your labels to get the data that is most meaningful to you.

## Benefits of using labels

With labels, you can:

- Run a report to compare “Holiday 2019” and “Holiday 2020” performance across campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
- Run a report to compare ads and keywords that include brand names against ads and keywords that use generic terms.
- Quickly filter and view performance for keywords labeled "Suggested by Microsoft Advertising".
- Create an automated rule to change bids on keywords labeled “CPA bidding.”

The important thing is that it’s all up to you. You decide what your labels mean and how to apply them to your campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.

## Manager account level labels vs. Account level labels
You can apply manager account level labels at any account level under that manager account. You can also apply these labels at campaign, ad groups, ads, and keyword levels within any of these accounts.

Anyone who has access to a manager account (even via hierarchy/manager account link) can see and manage those labels within the label’s manager account. If an agency links to a single ad account, they can't see the manager account level labels above that account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use labels from other manager accounts at the account level.
> You can only use account level labels on that account or anything under that account.

## How to create labels
1. [!INCLUDE [Labels](./includes/Labels.md)]
1. Select **Add label**.
1. In the **Label name** field, enter a unique name that will be meaningful to you.
1. Optional: Select the color picker and choose a color for your label. Select anywhere outside of the color picker when you are done.
1. Enter a **Description** for your label.
1. Select **Save**.

## How to apply labels
1. From the top menu, select **Tools** > **Accounts** to go to **Accounts overview**.
1. [!INCLUDE [Labels](./includes/Labels.md)]

1. [!INCLUDE [AllCampaigns](./includes/AllCampaigns.md)]
1. From the page menu on the left, select either **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Ads and extensions**, or **Keywords**.
1. [!INCLUDE [Labels](./includes/Labels.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> In the table, the right-hand columns show the number of campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords that have each label.
> If a label has 16 ads, for example, you can select the number **16** to go to the Ads tab, which will show only ads with this label.

## View label data in the Dimensions tab
1. [!INCLUDE [ReportsManagerAccountLabels](./includes/ReportsManagerAccountLabels.md)]

1. [!INCLUDE [ReportsAccountLevelLabels](./includes/ReportsAccountLevelLabels.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other Dimensions tables, you will see a summary **Unlabeled** row below your list of labels. This shows the performance data for all items not associated with the labels in the table. If you don’t have any filters applied, the **Unlabeled** row represents all items without labels. If you filter on 3 labels out of 10, for example, this row will represent all items without these 3 labels. This can be a handy way to compare groups of labels.
