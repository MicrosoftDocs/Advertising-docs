# What can I do with labels?

Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on whatever is important to you. You can then filter and run reports on your labels to get the data that is most meaningful to you.

## Benefits of using labels
With labels, you could:

- Run a report to compare “Holiday 2015” and “Holiday 2016” performance, across campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
- Run a report to compare ads and keywords that include brand names against ads and keywords that use generic terms.
- Quickly filter and view performance for keywords labeled "Suggested by Microsoft Advertising".
- Create an automated rule to change bids on keywords labeled “CPA bidding.”

The important thing is that it’s all up to you. You decide what your labels mean and how to apply them to your campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.

## How to create labels
1. On the **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Ads**, or **Keywords** tab, click the **Labels** drop-down list (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** > **Shared library** > **Labels**).
1. Click **Create label**.
1. In the **Label name** field, enter a unique name that will be meaningful to you.
1. Click **Save**.

## How to apply labels
1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click either **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Ads and extensions**, or **Keywords**.
1. From the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** > **Shared library** > **Labels**.

## How to manage labels
From the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** &gt; **Shared library** &gt; **Labels**.
> [!NOTE]
> In the table, the right-hand columns show the number of campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords that have each label.
> If a label has 16 ads, for example, you can click the number **16** to go to the Ads tab, which will show only ads with this label.

## Labels in the Dimensions tab
To view label data in the Dimensions tab:

1. On the **Campaigns** page, click **Dimensions** (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Reports** > **Dimensions**).
1. Click the **Show** drop-down list and select either **Labels: Campaign**, **Labels: Ad group**, **Labels: Ad**, or **Labels: Keyword**.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike other Dimensions tables, you will see a summary **Everything else** row below your list of labels. This shows the performance data for all items not associated with the labels in the table. If you don’t have any filters applied, the **Everything else** row represents all items without labels. If you filter on 3 labels out of 10, for example, this row will represent all items without these 3 labels. This can be a handy way to compare groups of labels.
