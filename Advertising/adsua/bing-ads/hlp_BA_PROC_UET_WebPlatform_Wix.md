# Set up UET tags using Wix

If you created and manage your website with Wix, you can add and manage your UET tag there.

## Implementing UET using Wix

1. In Microsoft Advertising, go to **Conversion Tracking**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**UET tags** and copy your JavaScript UET tag tracking code.
1. Log into your Wix dashboard and click **Manage Site**.
1. Select **Edit Site** and then **Use Advanced Editor** to enter editor mode.
1. On the left side of the editor, click **Add**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**More**.
1. Click **HTML Code**.
1. Click **Enter Code** and paste your UET tracking code in the text box.
1. Click **Update** to save your changes.
1. Repeat this process for all of the pages of your website.

> [!NOTE]
> To validate that your Wix UET tag is working, download and install [UET Tag Helper](./hlp_BA_CONC_UET_TagHelper.md). Go to your Wix website and verify that a UET event is received and that the **Tag ID** matches the tag you selected in Step 1.
