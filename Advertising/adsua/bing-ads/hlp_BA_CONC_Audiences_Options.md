# What are my options for audiences?

Audiences are groups of potential customers that you can target. Microsoft Advertising offers several different types of audiences you can use to get your ads in front of the right people.

## What if a customer is in more than one audience? Am I charged for multiple bid adjustments?

No, you will only be charged once.

A customer could either be:
- In multiple audiences within the same audience type (for example, remarketing list A and remarketing list B), or
- In multiple audiences across different audience types (for example, remarketing list A and in-market audience C).

When this happens, only the audience with the highest bid adjustment is attributed. Bid adjustments are not combined, and you are only charged once. If the bid adjustments are the same for all applicable audiences, one audience is chosen for attribution by the system and you are charged once.

## Can I use a "Target and bid" setting for one audience list and a "Bid only" setting for another audience list in the same ad group or campaign?

No, you can only select one targeting setting per ad group or campaign that will apply to all your audience lists in that ad group or campaign (either "Target and bid" or "Bid only"). It isn't possible to use different targeting settings in the same ad group or campaign for remarketing lists, in-market audiences, and custom audiences. Whichever setting you've selected most recently ("Target and bid" or "Bid only") overrides any previous settings.
