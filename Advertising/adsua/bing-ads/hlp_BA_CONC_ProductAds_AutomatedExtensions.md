# Enhance product ads with Automated Extensions

Microsoft Advertising can enhance your product ads with Automated Extensions.  The visibility and performance of your ads are improved by displaying extra information about your business - more clicks means more customer traffic! Automated Extensions are automatically added to your product ads if Microsoft Advertising determines that the Automated Extension can improve your product ad performance.

Automated Extensions show data from any of the sources – your ad landing pages, ad copies, and domains your ad copy points to. Certain data, like reviews and ratings, may be provided from third-party providers.

All advertisers are eligible for Automated Extensions, however, they are not always guaranteed to show in the product ads.

Here are the different types of Automated Extensions available **only** for product ads from Microsoft Advertising. Keep in mind that these are examples only and your ad might look a little different than shown below.

The clickable Elite Merchant Badge provides consumers with an easy way to identify ads from high-quality advertisers.

The badge is based on merchant rating scores, which are aggregated from third-party rating sources. Websites with a high merchant rating score are eligible for the Elite Merchant Badge. Keep in mind that a high merchant rating score does not guarantee that the badge will be shown in your ad.
