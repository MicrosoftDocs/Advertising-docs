# Enhance product ads with Automated Extensions

Microsoft Advertising can enhance your product ads with Automated Extensions.  The visibility and performance of your ads are improved by displaying extra information about your business - more clicks means more customer traffic! Automated Extensions are automatically added to your product ads if Microsoft Advertising determines that the Automated Extension can improve your product ad performance.

Automated Extensions show data from any of the sources â€“ your ad landing pages, ad copies, and domains your ad copy points to. Certain data, like reviews and ratings, may be provided from third-party providers.

All advertisers are eligible for Automated Extensions, however, they are not always guaranteed to show in the product ads.

Here are the different types of Automated Extensions available **only** for product ads from Microsoft Advertising. Keep in mind that these are examples only and your ad might look a little different than shown below.
