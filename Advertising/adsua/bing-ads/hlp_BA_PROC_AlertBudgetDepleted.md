# Fix the Campaign out of budget/Budget pause status

Your campaign is out of budget, so we paused all the campaign's ads. Ad display will resume at the start of the next day.

To resume your ads now, you can increase your budget.

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Campaigns** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Campaigns**).
1. In the **Campaigns** table, find the campaign that has the delivery status of **Campaign out of budget**.
1. Click the budget for the campaign, and then enter a new budget amount.
1. Click **Save**.
