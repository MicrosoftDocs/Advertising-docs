# Using PayPal to pay your charges

Microsoft Advertising accepts PayPal in select markets for prepay accounts funded in Canadian dollar, euro, Mexican peso, Norwegian krone, UK pound, or US dollar. To find out whether PayPal is an option for you (based on your country, currency, and type of account), see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md)

## Adding a PayPal account as a payment method
1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Click **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Click **Add PayPal**.
1. Enter a billing address if you're prompted to do so. Otherwise, click ** Next** to be directed to the PayPal site.
1. If you already have a PayPal account, sign in. If you do not have a PayPal account, sign up for a PayPal account.
1. After you've signed in to your PayPal account, review and agree to the Microsoft Advertising billing agreement.
You will be redirected back to Microsoft Advertising.

1. In **Payment Methods**, click **Add funds** and follow the instructions to add a prepay amount.

## Updating your PayPal account's friendly name or address
**Please note:**  These instructions only apply to PayPal accounts that were added to Microsoft Advertising before November 2017. Now, Microsoft Advertising no longer requires a friendly name or an address to add a PayPal account as a payment method.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Click **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Next to the PayPal account you want to update, click **Edit**.
1. Make any necessary changes.
1. Click **Save**.

> Only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)
> By agreeing to the Microsoft Advertising billing agreement, you are authorizing Microsoft Online Services to charge Microsoft Advertising fees to the PayPal account. PayPal does not share any of your financial information with Microsoft.
> Signing up for a PayPal account is subject to the PayPal &nbsp;[User Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398367) and [Privacy Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398368) outlined on the PayPal site.
> If you want to remove a PayPal account completely from Microsoft Advertising, you'll need to make sure that the PayPal account is not a primary payment method for any of your Microsoft Advertising accounts. ([!INCLUDE [DeletePI](./includes/DeletePI.md)]) Then you can go to the PayPal website and delete the Microsoft Advertising account from there.
> Before March 2016, customers had the option to use PayPal for postpay accounts. Customers who set up PayPal prior to this date can continue to use PayPal for their postpay accounts. New customers will need to create a prepay account if they want to use PayPal.
