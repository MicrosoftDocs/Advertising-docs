# Using PayPal to pay your charges

Microsoft Advertising accepts PayPal in select markets for prepay accounts funded in Canadian dollar, euro, Mexican peso, Norwegian krone, UK pound, or US dollar. To find out whether PayPal is an option for you (based on your country, currency, and type of account), see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md)

> By agreeing to the Microsoft Advertising billing agreement, you are authorizing Microsoft Online Services to charge Microsoft Advertising fees to the PayPal account. PayPal does not share any of your financial information with Microsoft.
> Signing up for a PayPal account is subject to the PayPal &nbsp;[User Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398367) and [Privacy Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398368) outlined on the PayPal site.
> If you want to remove a PayPal account completely from Microsoft Advertising, you'll need to make sure that the PayPal account is not a primary payment method for any of your Microsoft Advertising accounts. ([!INCLUDE [DeletePI](./includes/DeletePI.md)]) Then you can go to the PayPal website and delete the Microsoft Advertising account from there.
> Before March 2016, customers had the option to use PayPal for postpay accounts. Customers who set up PayPal prior to this date can continue to use PayPal for their postpay accounts. New customers will need to create a prepay account if they want to use PayPal.
