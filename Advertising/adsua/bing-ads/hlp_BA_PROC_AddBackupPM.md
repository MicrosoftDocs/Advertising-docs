# Add a backup payment method

If you want to avoid gaps in your advertising campaign caused by unforeseen problems with your primary payment method (for example, your credit card expires or is lost or stolen), you should add a backup payment method. Backup payment methods are only used with postpay threshold account. Read more about [primary and backup payment methods](./hlp_BA_CONC_AvailablePaymentMethods.md).

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectAccount_VR](./includes/SelectAccount_VR.md)]
1. Click **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. If you need to add a payment method to use as a backup, click **Add card** and follow the instructions.
1. Next to the payment method that you want to use as a backup, click **Set as backup**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)
> If your account country requires a tax ID (for example, Australia), then your primary and backup payment methods need to be from the same country. If you try to set			a backup payment method from a different country, you will be given the option to go the Accounts tab and enter primary and secondary			payment methods as well as a tax ID.
