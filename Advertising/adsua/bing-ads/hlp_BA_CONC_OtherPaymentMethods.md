# What does “Other Payment Methods” mean?

If you have one account and you have a payment method that isn't valid to use with that account, it will be listed under **Other Payment Methods**.

There are a number of reasons that a payment method can't be used for a particular account.

- **Account type.**  Some payment methods, such as credit cards, can be used with both postpay and prepay accounts.      Other payment methods, such as wire transfers, require a prepay account. For information on which payment methods you can use with prepay and postpay      accounts, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).
- **Currency and country.**  Some payment methods can only be used if your account is based in a specific country and uses a specific currency.      For example, PayPal can only be used if you have a Microsoft Advertising account with the currency set to Canadian dollar, euro, Mexican peso, Norwegian krone, UK pound, or US dollar. For information on which payment methods you can use for your currency and country, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).
- **Agency management.**  If your account is managed by an agency and they are responsible for paying the bill,       then the payment method cannot be used.
- **Inactive accounts.**  When an account is deleted and becomes inactive, no payment methods can be used.
