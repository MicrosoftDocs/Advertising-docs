# Unified Smart campaigns: Create an ad campaign

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Unified Smart campaigns are a simple and easy way for you to advertise across different search and social ad platforms. We use Microsoft AI to create text ads to help optimize your search advertising campaigns for you.

## Create an ad campaign

You can create a campaign during and after signup. The steps are identical except how you get to the campaign setup page. During signup you’ll immediately start with the campaign setup. To create a new campaign after you have signed up, from the **Ads page,** select **Create new campaign** from the main menu on the left.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want the flexibility to manage this account in Microsoft Advertising Editor or other third-party applications, consider switching to Expert mode before proceeding. Otherwise your account can only be updated in Microsoft Advertising.

1. Go to the Microsoft Advertising page and select **Sign up now**.
1. Sign in with your email address. If you already have a Microsoft Advertising account in expert mode, then you can’t use the same email address when signing up for another account in smart mode, and vice versa.
1. Choose your advertising goals e.g., visits to your website, phone calls to your business, or visits to your physical business locations.
1. Enter the website you want customers to visit and select **Next**.
1. Review and edit as needed your business location and phone details, budget, keyword themes, and where your ads will appear. We will suggest ads based on your website, business location, and phone number.
1. Review, edit, and add text ads for the Microsoft Search Network. Select **Turn on Google** to show the same search ads there.
1. Optionally connect Facebook and [follow the instructions](./hlp_DMC_CONC_AccountSettings.md) to run social ads on Facebook and Instagram. Then select **Create new image ad** or **Create new video ad** and provide the ad details and media.[Learn more about image and video requirements](./hlp_DMC_CONC_ImageVideoRequirements.md).
1. Add a payment method for search advertising. You’ll only be charged by Microsoft Advertising for spend on Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads search advertising platforms. Any spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook. [Learn more about billing options](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md).
1. Review your campaign details and make any adjustments in this last step. Once you've verified that everything looks good, submit your campaign!

After you create a campaign, Microsoft Advertising will perform a quick review of your ad content against advertising policies. Most reviews take less than a day. After that, your ads will start running. [Learn more about editorial reviews and ad approval](./hlp_DMC_CONC_UnderstandDisapprovedAds.md).

On the **All campaigns** page, you can monitor how your [campaigns are performing](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CampaignPerformance.md). You'll see search and social metrics including Impressions, Clicks, Direction inquiries, Calls, Conversions, Spend, and Engagement.

Set up [customer action tracking](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCT_AddTag.md) to learn what potential customers do after they click your ad, including the pages they visit on your website, how long they spend there, and more! Customer action tracking can give you a clearer picture of your return on investment (ROI) for your advertising campaigns.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes, including budget changes, made outside of Microsoft Advertising to ad campaigns created by Microsoft Advertising will be automatically overridden. Use Microsoft Advertising to make any changes to the ad campaigns created by Microsoft Advertising.

## Text ads for search

Create or edit text ads (also called search ads) to run on Google and Bing. When people search for words or phrases related to your products or services, text ads display on their search results pages.

On the **Create text ads** page, we provide suggested text ads, based on your website and business category. You should verify and edit the elements of your ad, if needed, to ensure the best message reaches potential customers.

**Final URL** : This is the webpage URL that potential customers go to when they click your ad. If you send a potential customer to a webpage that is tailored to what your ad highlights, such as a product page, sign-up page, or contact page, they're more likely to take action.

**Ad title (parts 1-3)** : The ad title is the most prominent part of your ad and serves as a link to your website. The best way to encourage customers to find and click your ad is to include keywords in your ad title that relate to the product or service you're advertising.

**Ad text (parts 1-2)** : The ad text appears below your ad title. Use the ad text to convince people to click your ad. What sets your product or service apart? Is it the price? Does it solve a problem or provide a benefit? Include a call to action for customers to click **right now**.

[!INCLUDE [AutomatedTextAds](./includes/AutomatedTextAds.md)]
> [!NOTE]
> In Unified Smart campaigns you can only edit the top performing automated text ads. To view the top performance social and search ads, go to the **Top ads** tab in the **Ads** tile on the **Ads** page. The top text ads are shown whether they were created by you or automated by Microsoft AI.

## Image and video ads for social

Create image and video ads to run on Facebook and Instagram. Image and video ads can be shown in the social media feeds of your potential customers.

To manage your social presence through Microsoft Advertising, you can [connect your social profiles](./hlp_DMC_CONC_AccountSettings.md), including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
