# Unified Smart campaigns: Editorial reviews and ad approval

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
## The editorial review

After you submit an ad in Microsoft Advertising, the ad text, media, and links must pass an editorial review to help ensure that your ads are relevant, clear, accurate, and appropriate for potential customers. Familiarizing yourself with advertising policies can make the approval process much quicker.

Each advertising platform approves or disapproves your ads based on their advertising policies:

- **Search** : Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising
- **Social** : Facebook Ads for ads on Facebook and Instagram

|Type of ad|Results of editorial reviews|What happens|
|---|---|---|
|Search|Both Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising approve your ad.|Your ad becomes active and is eligible to run on both platforms.|
|Search|Microsoft Advertising approves your ad, but Google Ads disapproves your ad.|Your ad receives a **Partially disapproved** status in Microsoft Advertising. The ad is eligible to run on Microsoft Advertising, but not eligible to run on Google while it's disapproved.|
|Search|Google Ads approves your ad, but Microsoft Advertising disapproves your ad.|Your ad receives a **Partially disapproved** status in Microsoft Advertising. The ad is eligible to run on Google, but not eligible to run on Microsoft Advertising while it's disapproved.|
|Search|Both Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising disapprove your ad.|Your ad receives a **Disapproved** status in Microsoft Advertising and won't run on either platform.|
|Social|Facebook Ads approves your ad.|Your ad becomes active and is eligible to run on Facebook and Instagram.|
|Social|Facebook Ads disapproves your ad.|Your ad receives a **Disapproved** status in Microsoft Advertising and won't run on Facebook or Instagram while it's disapproved.|

> [!NOTE]
> - The editorial status can be found on the **Ads** page in the **Disapproved ads** tile. This tile is only shown if you have disapproved content. You can also find the status in the **Ad preview** tile for each campaign.
> - Editorial checks do not stop once an ad is live. There are ongoing reviews to help ensure a quality marketplace. For this reason, previously displayed ads may be disapproved.

## Review the policy and disapproval reason

1. On the **Ads** page, select the campaign with disapproved ads.
1. On the **Ad preview** tile, find the disapproved ad, and select **Disapproved**.
1. Review the advertising platform that disapproved the ad and the policy violation.
1. Select the link to the policy and review the details of the policy violation.
   - For Facebook Ads, the link takes you to Facebook [Advertising policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2131968) that apply to ads on Facebook and Instagram, where you can search for the specific policy that applies to your ad and review their standards.
   - For Google Ads, the link takes you to [Google Ads policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2131967), where you can search for the specific policy that applies to your ad and review their standards.
   - For Microsoft Advertising, the link takes you to the specific policy that applies to your ad. View all the [Microsoft Advertising policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341).

After you've reviewed the policy, you can edit your ad to comply with the policies or challenge the disapproval by requesting an exception. Your ad will go through the editorial review process again. Most reviews take less than a day, so you can check for the results after a day or two.
