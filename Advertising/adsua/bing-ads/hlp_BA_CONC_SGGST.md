# Singapore Goods and Services Tax

Effective 1 January 2020, Microsoft Advertising is required to charge the Singapore Goods and Services Tax (SG GST) for businesses registered in Singapore If you provide your SG GST registration number, Microsoft Advertising will apply SG GST at 0%. If you do not provide your SG GST registration number, Microsoft Advertising is required to charge 7% SG GST. (Note: tax rate is subject to change.)

Microsoft Advertising cannot provide guidance on tax. Please contact your tax advisor or local tax office if you have questions.

## How is GST applied to my account?

- If you have a postpay threshold or monthly invoice account, GST is added onto your billing threshold amount. For example, if your billing threshold is S$100 SGD, your card will be charged S$107 SGD (S$100 SGD + 7% GST). [Learn about billing thresholds.](./hlp_BA_CONC_BillingThreshold.md)
- If you have a prepay account, some of your prepay funds will go towards taxes. For example, if you added S$100 SGD to your prepay account, S$6.54 SGD would cover taxes and the remaining S$93.46 SGD would cover advertising charges.
