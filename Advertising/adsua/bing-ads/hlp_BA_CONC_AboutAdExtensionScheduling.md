Control when your ad extensions will show to customers with ad extension scheduling. You can have them show on certain days or during certain hours, so you can best cater to your targeted customers.

## Get to know ad extension scheduling

- Ad extension scheduling is available for all extension types, except for Image Extensions.
- You can implement ad extension scheduling through Microsoft Advertising, Google Import, Bing Ads API, and Bulk Upload.
- Don’t forget that ad extensions are not guaranteed to serve. An ad extension serves depending on a number of factors, so scheduling your ad extensions doesn’t guarantee that the extensions will show then. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=746651)
