# How do I create a search ad campaign?

Creating a new search ad campaign in Microsoft Advertising is easier than ever!

1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Campaigns** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Campaigns**).
1. Click **Create campaign**.
1. Click the appropriate goal for this campaign. Setting your goal right at the start lets us suggest the most helpful features for your campaign. You'll still have access to all Microsoft Advertising features regardless of the goal you choose.
1. Select **Search ads** as the type of ads you want to run.
1. The campaign creation wizard will then walk you through the four-step process.

Here is some information about what you'll see in each step:

## 1. Campaign settings
In the first step, you give us the basic details of your campaign:
<table type="type1">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Campaign name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  Give your campaign a unique name. It's a good idea to have your campaign's name reflect its goal.
  <para>
    Note: A campaign name cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
     </para></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Campaign budget</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  This is the amount of money you want to spend per day. [Learn more about your budget options](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBudgetType.md) 
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Language</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  This is the language you'll write your ads in. This should match the language of the sites that you'd like your ads to appear on. [Learn more about language options in Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutLanguageOptions.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Location</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  This is where in the world you want your ads to appear. You can target or exclude specific countries/regions, states/provinces, cities, or zip/postal codes. [Learn more about how language and location targeting affect who can see your ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Who?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  If you're targeting by location, who exactly should see your ads? People <strong>in</strong> your targeted locations, people <strong>searching for or viewing pages about</strong> your targeted locations, or both?
                </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 2. Ad groups &amp; keywords
In the second step, you set the ad groups and keywords for your campaign. Campaigns are made up of ad groups, and ad groups are made up of sets of tightly-related keywords. Keywords are the words or phrases people search on when looking for a product or service.  [Learn more about keywords and how to build keyword lists](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutKW.md)
<table type="type1">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Your website</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  Enter the URL of your website, and Microsoft Advertising will search it for ad group and keyword suggestions. If your website doesn't have all its necessary content yet, select the <strong>My website is not ready</strong> checkbox. 
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Get keyword suggestions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  If you entered a URL for <strong>Your website</strong>, this is where you'll see our suggested ad groups and keywords. You can also enter a different URL or a word or phrase relevant to your product or service and get keyword suggestions for it. Click the arrows to move ad groups or keywords into the <strong>Enter keywords</strong> box on the left.
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Enter keywords</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  If you're entering keywords manually, type or paste them here. In this box, you'll also set the appropriate match type for your keywords. [Learn more about keyword match types](./hlp_BA_CONC_MatchOptions.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Add new ad group</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  You likely have more than one facet of your campaign, so it's a good idea to create a separate ad group for each. For example, if you sell menâ€™s clothes, you might have separate ad groups, with separate keyword lists, for dress shirts and casual shirts.

                </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. Ads &amp; ad extensions
In the third step, you create the ads for your campaign:
<table type="type1">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Ad type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  [Learn about the different types of ads you can create](./hlp_BA_CONC_AdOptions.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Creating ads</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  We recommend creating multiple ads in each ad group. Experiment with your wording and keywords so you can see what works best. [Here are some tips on writing effective ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutWritingEffectiveAds.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Ad extensions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  Ad extensions are additional pieces of information about your business that you can add to your ads. We will feature the ad extensions that are most relevant to the campaign goal you set at the very start. [Learn more about ad extensions](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdExtensions.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 4. Budget &amp; bids
In the fourth step, you review your campaign budget and set your bids:
<table type="type1">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Campaign budget</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  This is the amount that you set in the first step. You can make changes to it in this step and see how it affects your estimated performance.
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Bid strategy</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  Your bid strategy setting tells Microsoft Advertising how you want to manage your bids. [Learn more about bid strategies](./hlp_BA_CONC_BidStrategy.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Ad group bid</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  Try changing the bid amounts and see how the performance estimates in the table change. [Learn more about these performance estimates](./hlp_BA_CONC_UnderstandingPerfEsts.md)
                </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Advanced campaign settings</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                  Here you have the option to change your campaign's [targeting](./hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md) settings.
                </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After you click **Save** in the fourth step, your search ads will begin appearing on the Microsoft Search Network shortly, unless there is [an error with your account](./hlp_BA_CONC_AccountErrors.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have an existing campaign in another online advertising program, such as Google Ads, you can simply import your campaigns into Microsoft Advertising. For more information, see [Import campaigns directly from Google Ads](./hlp_BA_PROC_ImportCampaign.md).
