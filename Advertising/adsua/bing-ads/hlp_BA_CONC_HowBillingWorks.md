# What are my billing options? Pay now or pay later

Microsoft Advertising is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising service, which means we charge you each time your ad is clicked. There are two main ways to pay for those charges: prepay and postpay.

## Postpay threshold vs. prepay: What's the difference?

The big difference between a postpay threshold account and a prepay account is whether you pay after charges have accrued or before, but there are a few other smaller         differences described below.

    <th style="width:20%"></th>
    <th scope="col" style="width:40%;text-align:center">
              Postpay threshold

    <th scope="col" style="width:40%;text-align:center">
              Prepay

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
              <strong>When do I pay?</strong>
            </td>
    <td>
              <strong>Pay later.</strong>
               
              As your ads are clicked, charges accumulate. You pay for those charges either on your monthly billing date or when you reach your billing
              threshold, whichever comes first. Your monthly billing date is the monthly anniversary of your sign-up date for Microsoft Advertising. [!INCLUDE [BillingThresholdDef](./includes/BillingThresholdDef.md)] Learn [how billing threshold works](./hlp_BA_CONC_BillingThreshold.md).
            </td>
    <td>
              <strong>Pay in advance.</strong>
               
              As your ads are clicked, charges are deducted from funds that you’ve added to your account. When you run out of funds, your account is paused until more money is added. You can avoid having your account paused by [making automatic payments when your remaining balance gets low](./hlp_BA_PROC_AutoRecharge.md).

              When you set up a postpay account, you must add a credit card or other valid form of payment and set it as the primary payment method 
              for your account. Learn [how to add a credit card](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md).

              When you set up a prepay account, in addition to adding a payment method and setting it as primary, you must add funds to your account.

              Setting up a postpay threshold account with a credit or debit card is the fastest way to get your advertising campaign up and running.

    <td>
              <strong>Yes.</strong>
               
              If you have a postpay account, you can set a backup payment method, so that if your primary payment method doesn’t work (for example, the card expires), your account won’t be put on hold and your ads will continue to run.

              <strong>Yes, if you are paying with an online payment method, for example a credit card.</strong>
               
              You can set up auto-recharge so that funds are added to your prepay account whenever you reach 20% of the recharge amount.
              Learn how to [set up auto-recharge for a prepay account](./hlp_BA_PROC_AutoRecharge.md).
              With auto-recharge, you are required to set a primary payment method, so that we know which card to charge when your account funds run low.
