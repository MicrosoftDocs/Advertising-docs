# Managing bid adjustments in bulk

You can use bid adjustments, also known as incremental bids, to increase or decrease your bid for certain target customers. Bid adjustments can be made for demographics such as gender, age, and location. You can also target customers who are searching on certain days and/or time of day. Bid adjustments help you increase your chances of showing your ads to the customers who are most important to you. Targeting these customers can lead to a higher conversion rate and a better overall ROI for your ad campaign.

Rather than set bid adjustments individually for your location, ad schedule, and device, you can now do so in bulk at the campaign and ad group level.

1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns**.
1. Click either **Locations**, **Locations**, **Ad schedule**, or **Devices**.
1. From the table, click the target you want to set.
1. Enter a value to increase or decrease the bid by.
1. (Optional) Click **Preview** to see what will be changed.
1. Click **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you customize a targeting setting at the ad group level, you will need to manage it independently of your campaign level settings. Subsequent changes (such as bid adjustments) to the campaign level target criteria will not affect ad group level settings.
