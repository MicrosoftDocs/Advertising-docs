# Image guidelines and policies

When you're adding images to your ads, whether they’re images you upload or stock images provided by Shutterstock, you want to make sure that the images you use abide by Microsoft Advertising's guidelines and policies.

## Stock image policies

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Microsoft has partnered with Shutterstock to provide you with quality images you can in your ads for free.

There are some important Shutterstock stock image policies you must comply with:

- Images can only be used in ads created and served from Microsoft Advertising in their original, unaltered form.
- Images may not be used for adult content or unlawful content that infringes on any third party’s trademark or intellectual property rights.
- Images may not portray any person depicted in the image that is offensive, including the person in connection to adult content.
- Images may not be used as trademark, service mark, or logo.

## Image requirements for ad extensions

The requirements for adding an image to an extension are:

- **Accepted file types for images:**  JPEG, PNG, and GIF (without animation).
- **4:3 aspect ratio**  is required for the extension to be eligible to serve on Bing.
- Images must be relevant to the ad and landing page(s).
- We recommend that the image can also be found on the ad's landing page to ensure relevance.
- Upload high-resolution images only so they do not pixelate or degrade across screens.
- Images that are text-only, text-heavy, or contain phone numbers are not permitted.
- Text that functions as part of a logo is acceptable.
- For PNG images, the recommended best practice is to not use a transparent background.

When you upload an image, it'll automatically be cropped to four preset aspect ratios for your use.

If you're dissatisfied with the images auto-cropped into the four aspect ratios, you can upload your own images individually. Just make sure they adhere to the following specifications once they have been manually cropped.

Image dimensions for upload are limited to:

- **Minimum image dimensions:**  760 x 400 pixels
- **Maximum image dimensions:**  1900 x 1000 pixels
- **Recommended image dimensions:**  1200 x 628 pixels

|Aspect ratio|Min. dimensions (pixels)|Max. dimensions (pixels)|
|---|---|---|
|1.2 : 1|300 x 250|1200 x 1000|
|4 : 3|100 x 75|1333 x 1000|
|1.5 : 1|300 x 200|1500 x 1000|
|16 : 9|640 x 360|1778 x 1000|
