## Best practices for successful video ads

- Be creative and experiment with different lengths, intro text copy, headlines, and landing pages to see what resonates best with your audience. Focus on storytelling and great visuals, not the sale.
- Capture your audience's attention in ten seconds or less. Although your ads can run longer, the first ten seconds are critical to land your message. A/B test different lengths to see what works best.
- Showcase your brand identity early in the video.
- Make your video mobile and desktop friendly. Most people hold their phone vertically and a square aspect ratio will fit other screen formats.
- Design for sound off. People choose to watch videos with sound off in many situations. Use text, graphics, and captions whenever possible.
- Map your video to your campaign objectives. If you’re looking to drive awareness, focus on content that inspires and tells a story about your brand. For consideration, talk about your solutions and how your brand is positioned in the marketplace. For conversion, use video ads to provide more information about the products or services to drive to engagement or sales.
