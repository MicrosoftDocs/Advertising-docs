# Is my UET tag working?

The UET tags page has all the information you need to see if your UET tag is working correctly. You can validate the UET tag right in your browser using the UET Tag Helper. To learn how to install and use the UET Tag Helper, see [Test conversion goals and audiences with UET Tag Helper](./hlp_BA_CONC_UET_TagHelper.md).

## What to do if the UET tag is inactive
If the **Tracking status** column lists **Tag inactive**, then Microsoft Advertising has not received any user activity data from the UET tag in the last 24 hours. Make sure that the UET tag tracking code is still on your website. To add the UET tag tracking code, see [How do I add a UET tag to my website?](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2AddTag.md)
