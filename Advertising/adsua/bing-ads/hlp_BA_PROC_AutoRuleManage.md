# Edit, pause, or delete automated rules

On the Automated rules page you can enable, pause, delete, or edit your automated rules. This same page also provides a history of the rules that have run in the last 90 days. If the rule resulted in any changes, there will be a view details link that will show all of the updates made by the rule.

Need to add an automated rule? Find out how in our [introduction to automated rules](./hlp_BA_CONC_AutoRuleIntro.md).

To enable, pause, or delete an existing rule:

1. In the left panel, under **Bulk Operations**, click **Automated rules** (or from the main menu, click **All campaigns** and then from the page menu, click either **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Ads and extensions**, or **Keywords**. Then click **Automate**).
1. Select the checkbox next to the rules you want to change.
1. Click **Change status**, and then click **Enable**, **Pause**, or **Delete**.

To edit an existing rule:

1. In the left panel, under **Bulk Operations**, click **Automated rules** (or from the main menu, click **All campaigns** and then from the page menu, click either **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Ads and extensions**, or **Keywords**. Then click **Automate** and **Manage rules**).
1. In the **Action** column (on the right side of the page), click **Edit rule**.

When you edit a rule, the original rule is deleted and Microsoft Advertising creates new rule. This lets you track the changes resulting from both the new rule and original rule separately.

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword bid automated rules and [bid adjustments](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md) work independently of each other. If the criteria for both are met on a keyword bid, then both will be applied.
> If the author of an automated rule deletes his/her account, the automated rule will stop running.
