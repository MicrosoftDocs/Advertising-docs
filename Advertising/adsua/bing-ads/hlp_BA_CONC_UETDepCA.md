# Where are my Campaign Analytics goals?

Microsoft Advertising has been migrating all remaining active Campaign Analytics goals to UET goals since May 2016 and is removing Campaigns Analytics from Microsoft Advertising by the end of October 2016. If you haven’t already done so, you’ll want to ensure UET is set up so you can continue to track conversions (i.e. purchase, sign up, download) to your site. This can be done as easily as One, Two, Three:

1. In the left navigation pane, click **Conversion Tracking** and then **UET tags** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** and then **UET tags**).
1. Check if you have any auto-created UET tag with tag name “UETTag_Autogen_for_CA” on the UET tags page.
1. Create new conversion goals and UET tag.
If you have an auto-created UET tag, you can just skip this step and go straight to 3.      Otherwise, you will want to create new conversion goals and UET tag. To learn how, see [How do I create a conversion goal?](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2CreateGoal.md) and [How do I create a UET tag?](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2CreateTag.md)

1. Add the UET tag to your website.
Once you’ve got your conversion goals and UET tag, you’ll add the new UET tag to your website and remove any existing Campaign Analytics tags. To learn how, see [How do I add a UET tag to my website?](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2AddTag.md).
