# Create an account tracking template

URL tracking allows you to find out how visitors got to your website and gives you more information about the source of an ad click. All you need to do is add URL parameters to your tracking template and then when your ad is served, the parameters are dynamically appended to your landing page URL. To learn more, see [What is URL tracking in Microsoft Advertising?](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_WhatIsTracking.md)

For search campaigns, you can add tracking templates at these levels:

- Account
- Campaign
- Ad group
- Ad
- Keyword
- Sitelink Extension

For Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, you can now add tracking templates at the account, campaign, and ad group level along with the product group level.

We recommend adding the tracking template to your account. Then when you want to update a parameter or add a new one, you only need to make the change in one place and it applies to everything in that account.

1. [!INCLUDE [SettingsAccountSettings](./includes/SettingsAccountSettings.md)]
1. For **Tracking template**, enter one of these items:
   - {lpurl} followed by URL parameters and custom parameters which are separated by an ampersand (&amp;). For example, {lpurl}?matchtype={matchtype}&amp;device={device}. To learn more, see [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_URLParameters.md) and [Can I use custom parameters?](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_TrackTemplateCustomParam.md)
   - The URL you received from a third-party tracking tool or service. For example, http://www.trackingc.com/?url={lpurl}&amp;id=5

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't define custom parameters at the account level, but you can add custom parameters to the account tracking template that are defined at the campaign, ad group, ad, keyword, or sitelink extension level. To learn more, see [Can I use custom parameters?](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_TrackTemplateCustomParam.md)
> If you create a tracking template at the campaign, ad group, ad or sitelink extension level, it will override the account tracking template. When your ad is served, the lowest level tracking template will be appended to your landing page URL.
> The tracking template can be up to 2,048 characters. To learn more, see the section Have the URL character limits changed in the [FAQ: Upgraded URLs](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_FAQ.md).
> Make sure that you select final URL as your Landing page URL because tracking templates don't work with destination URLs.
> In a search campaign, you need to select **Final URL** as your landing page. Tracking templates don't work with **Destination URLs**.
