# Use recommendations to enhance your campaigns

Recommendations are AI-driven suggestions with one goal in mind: To help improve your campaign performance. Recommendations help you get the most out of your budget by improving bids, keywords, and ads, which can increase the overall efficiency of your campaigns. They also propose features you may not be taking advantage of and help you optimize existing ones.

## How recommendations work

Microsoft Advertising creates customized recommendations for you by using your account's historical performance, your campaign settings, and trends. Be sure to check the **Recommendations** tab often, because while sometimes you might not have any, we frequently find recommendations for you to apply.

## View, apply, or dismiss a recommendation

Recommendations that you apply become part of your ad rotation and should start to appear in searches within 48 hours. Those you dismiss are removed and may reappear in the future if the recommendation becomes available again.

1. [!INCLUDE [AllCampaignsRecommendations](./includes/AllCampaignsRecommendations.md)]
1. In each recommendation tile, you have options to:
- **Apply all** to immediately add all recommendations to your account.
- **View recommendations** to review the details of each recommendation. Here, you can **Dismiss** the ones you don’t want, or **Apply** the ones you do want by selecting one or more checkboxes > select **Apply**.
- Download a list of recommendations by selecting the ellipsis icon ![More information icon](../images/BA_ScreenCap_DeliveryDetails.png). From here, you can also **Dismiss** the recommendations or **Provide feedback** to help us better support you.

## Auto-apply recommendations

If you’d like specific recommendations from Microsoft Advertising to be automatically added to your account, you can opt in to auto-apply recommendations. When you opt in to auto-apply, we’ll notify you when the recommendations become available so you can review, apply, or dismiss them. After the review period, recommendations will be automatically applied to your account.
