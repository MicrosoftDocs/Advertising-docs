# Use Microsoft Advertising recommendations to enhance your campaigns

Recommendations are AI-driven suggestions with one goal in mind: Help improve your campaign performance. Recommendations help you get the most out of your budget by improving bids, keywords, and ads, which can increase the overall efficiency of your campaigns. They can also propose features you may not be taking advantage of as well as help you optimize existing ones.

## How recommendations work

Microsoft Advertising creates customized recommendations for you by using your account's historical performance, your campaign settings, and trends. Be sure to check the Recommendations tab often as we frequently find recommendations for you to apply.

## How do I view and apply a recommendation?
1. On the **Campaigns** page, click the **Recommendations** tab (or from the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns** and then click **Recommendations**).
1. Choose from one of the following categories:
- All recommendations
- Ads and Extensions

- Keywords and Targeting
- Repairs

1. Click **View recommendations** at the bottom of the recommendation tile.
1. Click **Apply**.
1. To apply all recommendations of a specific type, click **Apply all** at the bottom of the recommendation tile.

## How do I stop seeing or dismiss recommendations?
While we are always trying to help improve your campaign’s performance, sometimes a recommendation isn’t relevant to you or appropriate to your advertising goals. If you see a recommendation type that isn’t working for you, you can temporarily stop seeing them or dismiss them all together. Both options give you an opportunity to leave feedback to help us better support you.

**Stop showing this type of recommendation:** This will temporarily remove a recommendation type from the **Recommendations** tab.
