# Managing your user name to access multiple accounts

You can now access other people's manager accounts and the ad accounts they own through your own user name. By adding multi-user access to your existing user name, you effectively extend your reach by being able to access other people's accounts. The nice part: You don't need to remember another set of user names and passwords, and you don't need to log in and out of Microsoft Advertising to view different accounts owned by other people.

## Adding multi-user access to your user name

If you currently manage multiple user names to access Microsoft Advertising accounts, you'll need to contact your Account Manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to consolidate access.

Otherwise, you can gain multi-user access by accepting user invitations from others or by using your current user name to create new and separate Microsoft Advertising accounts. You may find that setup useful if you're an agency that wants to keep separate accounts per client, but you also want to give individual clients their own user names to access Microsoft Advertising for visibility and transparency.

## User roles

Along with access, you'll be assigned one of four user roles that gives permissions to perform specific account tasks. You can be a Super Admin, a Standard User, an Advertiser Campaign Manager, or a Viewer for each manager account you have access to. (See [About user roles](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md) for more details.)

For example, your user name grants you access to Manager Account A and Manager Account B. However, your Viewer user role limits you from making any changes on the accounts that Belong to Manager Account A. But as a Super Admin for Manager Account B, you have full control over that manager account and its ad accounts.

You can view the accounts you have access to along with the related user roles in the **Manage access** page, which is accessible in the menu next to the gear icon ![gear icon](../images/BA_Icons_Gear.png).

## Using multi-user access

## Switching from one manager account to another to view different accounts
Although you can access manager accounts with a single user name, you will need to switch from manager account to manager account to view the accounts that belong to each manager account. Manager accounts and their related ad accounts remain distinct.

1. Click on your user name just immediately to the left of the gear icon ![gear icon](../images/BA_Icons_Gear.png) to view the list of manager accounts you have access to.
1. You can click to view the **Default** manager account, which will always be at the top of the list. You can also click on frequently accessed manager accounts, which will be displayed under **Recent**. Or, you can click ** View all manager accounts** to see the full list. There, you can click on an individual manager account's tile to see its related ad accounts.

## Setting a default manager account
If you have access to several manager accounts and their ad accounts, you'll have the ability to choose a manager account to view when you sign in to Microsoft Advertising. However, you may want to set a specific manager account as the default so that you can see that manager account and their ad accounts right away when you sign in.

1. Click on your user name just immediately to the left of the gear icon ![gear icon](../images/BA_Icons_Gear.png) to view the list of manager accounts you have access to.
1. Click **Manage access**, located at the bottom of the list.
1. Click **set as default** under **Action** for the manager account that you to see immediately upon signing in to Microsoft Advertising.
