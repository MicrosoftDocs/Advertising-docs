# Smart campaigns: How your settings for locations, products, and services affect who sees your ads

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worryâ€”it's coming soon!

When you [create a smart campaign](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Intro.md), you give us several important pieces of information about your business:

- Your business category
- The products or services you want to advertise
- The language you want to advertise in
- The geographic locations you want your ads to run in

Our AI uses these settings to inform:

- What search phrases should trigger your ads
- Which people we should show your ads to
- Where in the world your ads should be shown

These are critical factors in the success of an ad campaign! As you [monitor your smart campaign's performance](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Monitor.md), consider these settings and make adjustments as you see fit.

## Editing your business category, products, services, or language
1. From the **All Campaigns** page, click **Campaign details** for the campaign you want to edit.
1. Click **Edit products or services**.
1. Update your settings.
As you add products or services, pay attention to the **Estimated number of potential customers** window on the right. This shows you how many people we estimate will search on the Microsoft Search Network for these products or services (within the locations you are targeting) each month.

1. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> We will suggest some products or services based on your website and the business category you've selected. We recommend adding any variation that is relevant to what you're advertising to maximize your campaign's reach.

## Editing the geographic location you want to advertise in
1. From the **All Campaigns** page, click **Campaign details** for the campaign you want to edit.
