# Smart campaigns: Add the tracking tag to your website

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

A critical part of [setting up customer action tracking](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCT_Intro.md) is adding a tracking tag to your website's code. This tag will report what customers do on your website to Microsoft Advertising.

## Add the tracking tag directly to your website

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to add the tracking tag to every page of your website.

1. Copy your tracking tag. You can find it by clicking the **More options** icon on your campaign's **Customer action tracking** pane and selecting **View tracking tag**.
1. Open the HTML for each webpage of your website.
1. Paste the tracking tag anywhere in the head section of your website's code—in other words, before the closing head tag: "&lt;/head&gt;".
1. Save the changes to your webpages.

## Add the tracking tag using your website platform

If you created and manage your website with one of the following website platforms, you can use it to add and manage your tracking tag.
