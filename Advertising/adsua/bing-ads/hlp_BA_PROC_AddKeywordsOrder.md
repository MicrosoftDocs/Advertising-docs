# How to add, edit or delete keywords

For an ad to go live, its ad group must contain at least one keyword. To learn more, see [What are keywords and how should I build my keyword list?](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutKW.md)

Before creating new keywords, if you have existing keywords in another online advertising program, consider [importing those keywords](./hlp_BA_PROC_ImportCampaign.md) into Microsoft Advertising. You can also [add negative keywords](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddNegativeKeywords.md).

## To create new keywords
1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click **Keywords**.
1. Click **Add keywords**.
1. Do one or both of the following:
   - Search for keywords to add by clicking **Research** and using one of the options in the dropdown list (**Find keywords containing a word or phrase**, **Find keywords on a website**, or **Find keywords on the destination websites for your ads**). From the results, choose the keyword you want to add and which match types you want to associate with that keyword (Broad, Phrase, Exact). Now click **Add** to get them added to your list.
   - Enter keywords directly by clicking **Enter keywords**. Type your keywords in the text box, then click **Add**. (Before adding, make sure to select the match types you want to associate with each new keyword by selecting the appropriate options in the **Type** column.)

1. Select the bid you want for each keyword and each match type.
1. When you have added the keywords you want to use, click **Apply**.

> [!NOTE]
> All keywords must adhere to [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md).
> [!INCLUDE [KeywordCharLimit](./includes/KeywordCharLimit.md)]
> Some common variations of keywords, such as adding punctuation ("'," "!") to a keyword,  count as duplicates in your list. Microsoft Advertising automatically removes all duplicates from the list, but these variations are still valid keywords for your ad.
> If using the broad match modifier, ensure that the "+" immediately precedes the keyword it modifies, with no spaces. For example:             
|Correct|Incorrect|
|---|---|
|Hawaii +Hotels|Hawaii + Hotels|
|+Hawaii +Hotels|+ Hawaii + Hotels|
|+Hawaii Hotels|+Hawaii+Hotels|

## To edit the status, match type or bid of an existing keyword
1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click **Keywords**.
1. Find the keyword you want to change in the table. Make sure you find the keyword that is associated with the correct campaign and ad group. If helpful, you can sort by campaign or ad group by clicking the appropriate column header.
1. Hover over the **Status**, **Match type** or **Bid** value that you want to change and click on the small pen icon that appears. You can then edit that value.
1. After you have made all your changes, click **Save** (located at the upper left corner of the table).

## To delete an existing keyword
1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click **Keywords**.
1. Find the keyword you want to delete in the table. Make sure you find the keyword that is associated with the correct campaign and ad group. If helpful, you can sort by campaign or ad group by clicking the appropriate column header.

1. From the table toolbar, click **Edit** and then click **Delete**.
