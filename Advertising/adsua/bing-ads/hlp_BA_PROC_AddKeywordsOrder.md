# How to add, edit or delete keywords

For an ad to go live, its ad group must contain at least one keyword. To learn more, see [What are keywords and how should I build my keyword list?](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutKW.md)

Before creating new keywords, if you have existing keywords in another online advertising program, consider [importing those keywords](./hlp_BA_PROC_ImportCampaign.md) into Microsoft Advertising. You can also [add negative keywords](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddNegativeKeywords.md).

> [!NOTE]
> All keywords must adhere to [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md).
> [!INCLUDE [KeywordCharLimit](./includes/KeywordCharLimit.md)]
> Some common variations of keywords, such as adding punctuation ("'," "!") to a keyword, count as duplicates in your list. Microsoft Advertising automatically removes all duplicates from the list, but these variations are still valid keywords for your ad.

## Create new keywords

1. [!INCLUDE [KeywordsKeywords](./includes/KeywordsKeywords.md)]
1. Select **Add keywords**.
1. Use the dropdown menu to **Select an ad group**.
1. **Enter keywords**.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectSave](./includes/SelectSave.md)]

## Edit the bid, match type, landing page URL, or landing page options for keywords

1. [!INCLUDE [KeywordsKeywords](./includes/KeywordsKeywords.md)]
1. In the table, select the checkbox next to the keywords that you want to change.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectEditAction](./includes/SelectEditAction.md)] For example, select **change current bids**.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectSave](./includes/SelectSave.md)]

## Enable, pause, or delete keywords

1. [!INCLUDE [KeywordsKeywords](./includes/KeywordsKeywords.md)]
1. In the table, select the checkbox next to the keywords that you want to delete.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectEditAction](./includes/SelectEditAction.md)] For example, select **Enable**, **Pause**, or **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [copy keywords from one ad group or campaign to another](./hlp_BA_PROC_CopyPaste.md).
