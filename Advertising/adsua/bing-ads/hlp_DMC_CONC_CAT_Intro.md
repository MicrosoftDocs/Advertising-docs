# Unified Smart campaigns: Set up customer action tracking

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Once you have a campaign up and running, what does your audience do when they get to your website? Set up customer action tracking to learn:

- How many people visit your website.
- How long they spend there.
- Whether or not they're visiting the pages that are most important to your business.

The last point is key, because your website is tailored to your own business goals. Is your goal to sell products, raise brand awareness, generate leads, drive foot traffic to your physical location, or something else? Customer action tracking can help you make sure that your advertising budget and social engagements are yielding results.
