# My rejected offer is non-appealable. What do I do?

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
During our editorial review process, we reject product offers that violate one or more of the [Microsoft Advertising Policies and Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341). Some rejected product offers are non-appealable; these include:

- The offer's policy violation is non-appealable.
- You have already appealed the rejection and were denied.
- You submitted the offer over 180 days ago.

## What to do if your offer is non-appealable

If your rejected product offers are non-appealable, you can review the advertising policies and guidelines and make changes to your offers. Then, reupload your catalog feed file in Merchant Center. Each time you upload a feed file for your store, we automatically check to see if the product offers comply with our policies and guidelines.

If you need further assistance, you may [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371).
