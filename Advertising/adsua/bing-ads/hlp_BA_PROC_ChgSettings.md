# Change your status, bid, and other settings

You can change some of your campaign, ad group, and keyword settings right from the Campaigns page. Take a look the examples below to see what you can change.

## To change campaign status or budget amount

1. [!INCLUDE [CampaignsCampaigns](./includes/CampaignsCampaigns.md)]
1. Above the table, select **Columns** > **Modify columns**.
1. Ensure the all of the columns you want to see are **Added**.
1. Select **Apply**.
1. Hover over the field you want to edit and [!INCLUDE [SelectPencil](./includes/SelectPencil.md)].
1. After you are done making your changes, select **Save**.

To change your budget type, take a look at [your different budget options](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBudgetType.md). Other changes can be made at the campaign level by selecting the campaign name (in the **Campaign** column) and then selecting **Settings**.
