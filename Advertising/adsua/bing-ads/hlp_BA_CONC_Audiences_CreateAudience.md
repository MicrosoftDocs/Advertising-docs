# Create an audience

[Audience targeting](./hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_WhatIs.md) lets you show your ads to specific groups of people who are likely to be interested in your products or services. The first step in audience targeting is to create an audience.

## How to create an audience

1. In the left pane, click **Shared Library** and then **Audiences** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** and then **Audiences**).
1. Click **Create audience**.
1. Give your audience a unique name.
1. Select the audience type you want to use.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Follow the instructions in the appropriate audience type's article:
