# Impressions

**What it is: **       The number of times an ad has been displayed on search results pages on the Microsoft Search Network or on sites on the Microsoft Audience Network.

**Why it's important: **       Regardless of whether you are driving customers to your website, tracking conversions, or just trying to get your message out, you want to track the number of times your ad is shown.

**Tip:**       Run the share of voice report to get an estimate of how many more impressions you could be getting.
