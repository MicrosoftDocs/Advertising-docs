# Text ads

**What it is:** Text ads, also known as search ads, display on search results pages when people search for words or phrases related to the products or services youâ€™re advertising. They run on search platforms (Google and Bing).

**What you need to know:**
- Text ads include an ad title, ad text, and the webpage URL that potential customers go to when they click your ad.
- In addition to text ads you create, we'll use Microsoft artificial intelligence (AI) to build text ads to help optimize your search advertising campaigns for you.
