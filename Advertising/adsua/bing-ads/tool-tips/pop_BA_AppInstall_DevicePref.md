# Device preference

**What it is:**  App install ads will serve on mobile and tablet devices but you can select this option to indicate your preference for your ads to appear on mobile devices.

**Why it's important:**  By selecting mobile device preference, you're requesting that this ad preferably appear for customers using mobile devices. Whether your ad only shows on mobile devices depends on a number of things, including your ad group device preferences and whether you have other ads in your ad group. Selecting this preference doesn't mean that your ads will be excluded from tablets.
