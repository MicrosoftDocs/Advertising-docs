# Video source

**What it is**:     This is where you choose the video that you want to appear in your audience ads.

**Why it's important**:     You can express your brand identity and deliver a message to interested customers. An engaging video will lead to clicks on the video and visits to your website.

**What you need to know**:     When you upload a video, we create multiple versions of it, each with a different aspect ratio. The ad preview area on the right side of the page will update to give you an idea of what your ad could look like. Audience ads are responsive and the final ad format is likely to change to naturally blend in with the fundamental experience of the page they are placed in.

The technical requirements for a video are:
- Duration: Must range from 6 to 120 seconds
- Recommended file formats: MPEG-2, MP4, or MOV are recommended
- Accepted aspect ratio: Must range from 16:9 to 9:16 such as 1:1
- Minimum resolution: Must be at least 120 x 120 pixels
- Recommended resolution: We recommend at least 720 x 720 pixels and as high as possible
- Maximum file size: The maximum video file size is 10 GB
