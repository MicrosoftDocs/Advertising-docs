# Bid only

**What it is**: If you choose this option, we will deliver ads to everyone who meets your other targeting criteria, while letting you make bid adjustments for specific industries.

**Why it's important**: This setting lets you bid more (or less) aggressively for the people who meet specific industry criteria, without restricting your ads to those people.
