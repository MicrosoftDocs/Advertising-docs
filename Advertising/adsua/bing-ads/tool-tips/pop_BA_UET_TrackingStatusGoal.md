# Tracking status

**What it is** : This is the status of your UET tag and conversion goalâ€”it lets you know if conversion tracking is working or not.

Note: For smart goals, this value displays as a dash (-) because it's not applicable. [Learn more about smart goals](../hlp_BA_CONC_SmartGoals.md)

**What you need to know** :

- **Unverified** : Microsoft Advertising hasn't received any user activity data from the UET tag on your website. It can take up to 24 hours for Microsoft Advertising to verify. If you still see this status, you either have not added the UET tag tracking code to your website or there is an issue with the setup that you need to fix.
- **No recent conversions** : We've seen your UET tag, but haven't recorded any conversions in the last 7 days. This is most likely because you either have created the goal incorrectly, have not tagged your entire website, especially the pages that have the conversion action or you don't have any users converting on your site.
- **Recording conversions** : We've seen your UET tag and have recorded conversions within the last 7 days. If your conversion window is greater than 7 days and you are filtering on the last 7 days, you may see this status even if no conversions are shown in the **Conversions** column, as conversions are reported at the time of the click.
- **Tag inactive** : Microsoft Advertising has not received any user activity data from the UET tag in the last 24 hours. Make sure that the UET tag tracking code is still on your website.
- **The tag is no longer available** : The account no longer has access to the UET tag. Permissions to a UET tag in another manager account may have been removed, or this account was transferred and lost permission to a UET tag in a previous manager account.
