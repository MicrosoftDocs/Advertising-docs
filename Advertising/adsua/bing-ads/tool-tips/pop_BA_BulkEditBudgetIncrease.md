# Increase budgets for multiple campaigns

**What it is:**        Increase the budgets for selected campaigns by a fixed amount or a percentage.

**What you need to know:**        If you add a maximum budget amount, none of your bids will go above that amount, except bids that were already more than the maximum.

**Example:**        You have three selected campaigns with different daily budgets: $100, $300, and $500. You increase the budget for these keywords by 50% and set the maximum budget to $400. Your first budget will be $150. Your second budget will be $400, because a 50% increase is greater than the maximum. Your third budget will remain at $500, because it is already higher than your maximum bid.
