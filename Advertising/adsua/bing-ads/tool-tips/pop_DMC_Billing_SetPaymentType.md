# Set as

**What it is:** Set your payment method type.
- **Primary payment method**Payment method charged for search advertising.
- **Backup payment method**Payment method that will be used if the primary payment method didnâ€™t cover all charges.
- **Additional payment method**Payment method that is only charged if you make a one-time payment, or if you later set it as the primary or backup payment method.

**What you need to know:**
- You cannot remove your primary card without replacing it. If you only have one card in Microsoft Advertising, add another card, and assign it as the new primary card. Once that is updated, you can remove your previous primary card.
- Microsoft Advertising accepts credit and debit cards only (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Network). We do not accept payments by prepaid cards.
