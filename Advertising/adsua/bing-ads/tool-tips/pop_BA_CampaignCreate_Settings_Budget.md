# Daily budget

**What it is:**  Daily budget is how much you're comfortable spending on this campaign per day and how you want to spend it.

**What you need to know:**  There are two settings here:
- Budget: The amount of money you want to spend per day.
- Daily budget options: With the Standard option, your budget will be spent evenly through the day. With the Accelerated option, your budget will be spent as quickly as appropriate.

**Note:**
- Accelerated budgets are not recommended for most advertisers.
- You will have the opportunity to review and change this budget amount later.
