# Average position

**What it is:**  The average position on the web page for ads that were delivered. Although it varies, positions 1-4 appear at the top of the search results page and positions 5-10 appear in other locations (for example, the bottom or the sidebar).

**Why it's important:**  Ads that are on the first search results page tend to receive more clicks.
