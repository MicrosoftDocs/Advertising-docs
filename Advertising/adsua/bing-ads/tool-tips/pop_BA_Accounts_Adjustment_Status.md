# Status

**What it is:** This describes the status of your adjustment, which can be:
- **In progress**
- **Rebilled**, which means that a document is no longer available for an adjustment because it was previously adjusted.
- **Invalid**, which happens when an offline payment is submitted for adjustment
- **Blocked**, which is a temporary hold placed on the last day of the month on aggregator and consolidated billing documents. This block is designed to prevent adjustments that will cause partial rebills for this month and next month. At the start of the new month, the block will be automatically removed so that you can adjust this document.
- **Partial adjustment**, which happens when a TQ credit is being applied at the same time as an account adjustment
- **Pending payment**, which means that the new billing document will be pending until we receive payment from the customer. During this period, the original document can be adjusted further.
- **PI declined**, which means that the customer's payment method has been declined. The system will reprocess the charge up to 10 times before the rebill fails and any outstanding amount due is sent to collections.
- **Failed**, which means that the rebill process failed because we could not successfully charge the customer's payment method. This document has been flagged for an outstanding debt and will be sent to collections.
- **Completed**
