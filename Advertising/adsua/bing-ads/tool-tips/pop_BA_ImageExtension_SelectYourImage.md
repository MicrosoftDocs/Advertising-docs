# Selecting images

**What it is:**  Use existing images or upload new images to appear on your extension.

**What you need to know:**  The requirements for adding an image to an extension are:
- **Accepted file types for images:**  JPEG, PNG, and GIF (without animation)
- **Minimum image dimensions:**  760 x 400 pixels
- **Maximum image dimensions:**  1900 x 1000 pixels
- **Recommended image dimensions:**  1200 x 628 pixels

When you upload an image, it'll automatically be cropped to the four preset aspect ratios for your use. The four aspect ratios are:

- 1.2 : 1
- 4 : 3
- 1.5 : 1
- 16 : 9
