# Ad title 1

**What it is:**        The ad title is the most prominent part of your ad and serves as a link to your website.

**What you need to know:**        With Expanded Text Ads, **Ad title 1** can be up to 30 characters long.

**Tip:**        The most obvious way to call someoneâ€™s attention to your ad is to include keywords in your ad title. You can do this manually or by using dynamic text.

**Using dynamic text in ad titles:**     Dynamic text is a word, phrase, or other information that is inserted into the ad title or text. Use the {KeyWord} variable to insert keywords in your ads that match, or closely match, the text that a customer typed. By using {KeyWord} in your ad title and text, Microsoft Advertising automatically inserts your keyword into the ad when that ad is displayed.

**Note:** 	   An ad title cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
