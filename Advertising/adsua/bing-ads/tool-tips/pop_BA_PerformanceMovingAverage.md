# Show moving average

**What it is:**         Moving average is calculated by averaging the performance metrics across the previous four days. 		All days are the same day of the week. It answers the question: How did my campaign do on this day compared with a typical day?

**Example:**         If you are looking at the number of clicks on a Wednesday, the moving average will be calculated by taking the average number of 		clicks for the four previous Wednesdays.

**What you should know:**        Moving average can be used as a baseline because it smooths out random fluctuations but it is only available for a time range up to 30 days.
