# Add shipping labels

**What it is:** Shipping labels allow you to further customize the shipping settings for the products in your Microsoft Merchant Center feed.

**What you need to know:** Add shipping labels that match to the shipping settings of a product in your feed. For example, you may ship fragile items at a premium. If you tag the shipping attribute in your feed as "Fragile", you can add a corresponding "Fragile" shipping label that specifies the **Shipping rate** and **Minimum purchase** requirement.
