# Ad title

**What it is:**  The clickable and most prominent part of your ad.

**What you need to know:**  Make sure to optimize the 25 characters Microsoft Advertising provides for your ad title. The most obvious way to call a searcher's attention to your ad is to include keywords in your ad title.

**Note:** 	   An ad title cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
