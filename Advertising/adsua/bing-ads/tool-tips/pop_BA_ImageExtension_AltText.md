# Alt text

**What it is:**  The text you enter here will be the name of your image extension as well as the alternative text, or alt text, for the image.

**Why it's important** : Alt text is the text that appears when someone hovers over your image with their cursor. It is also used by screen readers to describe the image to people with disabilities.
