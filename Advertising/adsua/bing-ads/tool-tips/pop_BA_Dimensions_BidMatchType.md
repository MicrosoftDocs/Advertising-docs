# Bid match type

**What it is:**   The match type associated with a particular keyword that you’re bidding on. The match types are: broad match, broad match modifier, phrase match, exact match, and negative match. The same keyword can have different match types, each with a different bid amount.

**Why it’s important:**   Keyword match types determine how closely a search query or other input must match your keyword. Running a report on this data helps you identify the   clicks and conversions coming from the match type you bid on, and if you should adjust your bids or match type. For example, if you used broad match and   a majority of the keywords in the report are not related to your ad, you might want to use exact match instead.
