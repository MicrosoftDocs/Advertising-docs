# Keywords

**What it is** : Keywords are the words or phrases you associate with your ads so potential customers searching the web can find your ads. To connect your ads with the right audience, think like a shopper. Select the words and phrases that an online customer would use to find your product or service.

**What you need to know** : In the **Enter keywords** box, you can type or paste keywords separated by commas or one keyword at a time. You can set the keyword match type by including brackets or quotes:
- Keyword = Broad match keyword
- "Keyword" = Phrase match keyword
- [Keyword] = Exact match keyword

**Tip** : For the best chance of success, we recommend that each ad group have at least 20 keywords. If you're having a hard time thinking of enough keywords, try using **Get keyword suggestions**.
