# Clicks

**What it is:**  Clicks are one of the metrics used to measure the performance of your advertising.

**What you need to know:**    This is the total amount of clicks for the set of campaigns belonging to this performance target. Clicks typically include a customer clicking on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).

**Tip:**   You pay for clicks on standard-quality clicks, not on low-quality or invalid clicks.
