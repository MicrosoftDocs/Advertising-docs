# Ad schedule

**What it is**: Our data suggests that setting ad schedule bid adjustments for these periods could give you more conversions or save you money.

**Why it's important**: People searching on different days or different times of day are more or less likely to convert, based on your conversion history in these periods. Raising or lowering your bid for specific periods could give you more conversions or save you money.

**What you need to know**: These estimates are based on performance data from the last 15 days and are not a guarantee of future performance.
