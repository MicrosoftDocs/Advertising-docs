# Amount due

**What it is:**     If this is a postpay account (either threshold or monthly invoice), you'll see the amount due for the account.

**What you need to know:**

- There can be a delay of up to 4 hours between the time someone clicks your ad and the time the charge appears in this column.
- Amount due does not apply to prepay accounts, so dashes will appear in the column.
