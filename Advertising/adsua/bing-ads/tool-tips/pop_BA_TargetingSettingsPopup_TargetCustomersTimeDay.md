# Target by time of day

Your ads are eligible to display every hour of the day, but in some cases, you might want to limit advertising to those times that you know your        target customer is searching for your product online (for example, midday and evening).

You can also make a bid adjustment: a percentage increase to your        keyword bid to improve the chance that your ad will display to people searching during a specific time of day.        For example, if your target customer is shopping for your products after work, you could increase your bid by 30% during 6 PM - 11 PM.

For more information, see [Using targeting to display your ads to the right people](../hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md)          and [Target customers with bid adjustments](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md).

> If you are creating a new campaign or ad group, you cannot apply a bid adjustment.            Bid adjustments are made on the ad group or campaign Settings page.
