# Product offer status

**What it is:** The status of your offers in your most recently uploaded catalog.

**What you need to know:** Each offer goes through five steps:
- **Initial processing:** Columns and file format are validated. (Average time: 1 hour)
- **Checking data format:** The [product offer attribute requirements](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBingMerchantCenterCatalogFile.md) are validated. (Average time: 6 hours)
- **Editorial verification:** Product offers are checked for compliance with [Microsoft Advertising policies](../hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md). (Average time: 4 hours)
- **Image collection:** Product images are collected and stored by Bing  (Average time: 8 hours)
- **Final processing:** Valid offers are published and rejection reports are created. (Average time: 5 hours)

Pending offers have passed the previous step, but have not yet completed the current step.

Rejected offers failed the current step and will not move to the next step.

The final two tiles summarize all five steps, showing the total rejected/pending offers and the published offers.

**Tip:** Within 24 hours of submitting your catalog, the final two boxes should add up to the total number of offers in your feed. If they don't, please contact Support. If you have rejected offers, click on **Download details** (below the tiles) to get more information on why each offer was rejected. Correct the errors and resubmit your catalog.

The numbers reported here might be temporarily out of sync with the current rejection and publishing report files that you download. This happens because the downloadable files can report on offers from an older feed file that has not yet been replaced by the latest feed file.
