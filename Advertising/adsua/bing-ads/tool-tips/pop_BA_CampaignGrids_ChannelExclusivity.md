# Channel exclusivity

**What it is** : Possible values for the Local Inventory Ads channel exclusivity include "Multi-channel" and "Single-channel."

- **Multi-channel** : Products that are sold both online and in stores.
- **Single-channel** : Products that are sold only online or in stores.

**What you should know** : If the campaign has not opted into Local Inventory Ads, all offers are by default Single-channel. For more information, see [What are Local Inventory Ads?](../hlp_BA_CONC_LocalInventoryAds_Intro.md).
