# Bid match type

**What it is:**   The match type associated with a particular keyword that you’re bidding on. The match types are: broad match, broad match modifier, phrase match, exact match, and  negative match.

**Why it’s important:**   Keyword match types determine how closely a search query or other input must match your keyword. Running a report on this data helps you identify the   clicks and conversions coming from the match type you bid on, and helps indicate whether you should adjust your bids or match type.
