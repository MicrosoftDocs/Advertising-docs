# Enable call only ads

When people view your ads on a smartphone, your phone number is clickable so that people can call you with a single touch. When you enable this, the phone number is the only link people can click from a smartphone. For example, people will not be able to click on your website.

> If your campaign is targeting other devices or networks, you may still receive headline clicks.
