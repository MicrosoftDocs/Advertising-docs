# List size: Audience

**What it is** : This shows how many people in your audience could be reached on the Microsoft Audience Network. These people were active on the Microsoft Audience Network within the last 30 days.

**What you need to know** : There are a few items that can impact your list size:
- After you create the audience or edit the **Membership duration**, **Whom to add to your list**, or **Tag name** sections, or have imported new custom audiences from DMP, it takes 24 hours to build it. The list size column will show a dash **"-"** while the audience is being built.
- If the UET tag associated with the audience has a status of **Unverified**, the audience can't receive the customer information from your website that it needs to build the audience.        The list size column will show a dash **"-"**.
- The audience needs to have at least 300 people on the Microsoft Audience Network in order for it to be eligible to serve.
- If, for any reason, we are not allowed to share list size data with you, the list size column will show “Restricted”.

**Why it's important** : This gives you an idea of how many people you can target with this audience.
