# Manual calls

**What it is:**     The number of calls made to a Call Extension number by dialing the number, rather than clicking the number. Although manual calls could be made to both metered (call forwarding) and non-metered numbers, in the context of Microsoft Advertising metrics, only data from manual calls made to a metered number is counted.
