# Benchmark bid

**What it is:**     Shows you how much other advertisers are bidding, on average, on similar products as your current target.

**Why it’s important:**     Use this information to compare your bidding strategy for a product group against that of other advertisers advertising similar products. If the benchmark bid is significantly higher than your bid, you might consider raising your bid.
