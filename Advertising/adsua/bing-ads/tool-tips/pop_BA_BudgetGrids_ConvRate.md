# Conversion rate

**What it is:**        The number of conversions, divided by the total number of clicks. For example, if the ads in your campaign received 300 clicks and 4 conversions, the conversion rate is 1.33%.

**Why it's important:**        The higher your conversion rate, the better your campaign and its ads are performing. A good conversion rate is generally between 2 and 3 percent.
