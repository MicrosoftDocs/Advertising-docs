# Segment

**What it is:**     Categories that you can apply to any table on the Campaigns page that you want to download. The segment organizes your performance data around the predefined criteria.

**Example:**  If you select **Time** and then **Day**, the downloaded report will show the last seven days of data for each campaign, which is an easy way to see how your campaign is doing right now.

**Tip:**  Make sure that the segment you select matches the date range. For, example if your date range is "Last six months" and you select "Week", the date range is too long.
