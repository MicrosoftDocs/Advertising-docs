# Product bought

**What it is:**  The product purchased from your catalog or via your retail partner.

**What you need to know:**  The purchased product will always match the same brand but can differ from the specific product ad that was clicked on. If different products were purchased as a result of one click, the report will include multiple rows with the same ad ID and merchant product ID, and will contain a unique ProductBought value. You can also include the QuantityBought column to get data on quantity purchased per product.
