# Start date

**What it is: **       You can schedule ads in a particular ad group to start on a specific date. For example, you might want to start running ads to align with a specific event, such as a sale.

**What you need to know: **       By default, the start date is the day you create your ad group. If you want to make changes to start date, go to ad group settings.
