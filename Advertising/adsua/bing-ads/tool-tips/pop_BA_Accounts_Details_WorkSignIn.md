# Require sign-in with a work account

**What it is:** If you want to restrict access to only authenticated individuals at your company, you can require users to sign in with a work account.

**What you need to know:** This feature is geared towards corporate users who have IT policies that require the use of work accounts for system access, including access to third-party tools. If enabled, users who have personal accounts (such as an account from Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo) won't be able to sign in to Microsoft Advertising with a Microsoft account. Please note that this feature only works with domains that are authenticated by Azure Active Directory.
