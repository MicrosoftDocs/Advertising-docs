# Multimedia ads bid adjustment

**What it is:**     You can adjust your bids for multimedia ads by specifying a multimedia ad bid adjustment at the campaign or ad group level. Any bid adjustment set for an ad group will take precedence over the campaign bid adjustment. Multimedia ads bid adjustment works the same way as other bid adjustments for Microsoft Advertising campaigns, and is a percentage (%) increase on bids for your multimedia ads.

**What you need to know:**         Multimedia ad bid adjustments can be +20% to +900%.
