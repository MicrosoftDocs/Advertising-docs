# Estimated all conversion rate

**What it is:**    The estimated number of conversions that result in a sale or another measure of success to a particular age group or gender, divided by the estimated number of clicks by that age group or gender. All conversions means every conversion is counted, regardless of whether or not **Include in "Conversions"** is selected for this conversion goal

**What you need to know: **    This value is an estimate because age and gender are not known for the entire audience.
