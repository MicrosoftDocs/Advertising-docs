# Document ID

**What it is:**     Each document has an ID for tracking purposes.

**What you need to know:**
- Click the Document ID to download the document in a PDF format.
- If you have set up consolidated billing for monthly invoiced accounts, you will see the word "Consolidated" below the link.
- For postpay threshold accounts, a pending document shows the advertising costs you've accrued before your cutoff (which takes place when you reach your billing threshold amount or the monthly billing date, whichever comes first). A pending document excludes tax charges. The pending status changes to the document ID number once you meet the cutoff. Your statement contains the final amount, including any applicable taxes.
