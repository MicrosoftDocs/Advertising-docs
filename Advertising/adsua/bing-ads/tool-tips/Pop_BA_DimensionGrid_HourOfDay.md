# Hour of day

**What it is:**     A number that tells you which hour of the day your data is from for the entire date range.     The numbers start with 0, which is 12:00 AM, and goes up to 23, which is 11:00 PM, in the account time zone.

**Why it’s important:**     You can use this information to identify if there is a specific hour where you get more traffic and then you can use bid adjustments to target that time.
