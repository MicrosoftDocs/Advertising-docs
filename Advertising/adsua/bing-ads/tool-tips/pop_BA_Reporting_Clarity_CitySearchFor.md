# City (searching for)

**What it is:**    The name of a city if the user’s geographical intent can be determined. The city is set if the user’s intent is related to a city, and not necessarily if they are physically located in the city. For example, the user’s search query was rental cars in Portland.

**Why it’s important:**    This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
