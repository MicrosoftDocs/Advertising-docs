# Clicks

**What it is: **The number of clicks your ad might receive on a weekly basis if the keyword is added to your account to trigger the ad. They typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on Bing, AOL, or Yahoo. Clicks can also come from other sources (for examples, spiders, robots, test servers).

**What you should know: **You pay for clicks on standard-quality clicks, not on low-quality or invalid clicks. Get more info: [Monitoring clicks: Telling the good from the bad](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutPreventingInvalidClicks.md)
