# Offer Count

**How to use:**  Specify how many product offers you will upload for this store using the Content API. The [Content API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=404097) allows you to automate the product feeds for your stores instead of manually uploading those feeds using FTP. If you're submitting more than 20 million offers, please [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to be enabled for API management.

**What you need to know:**  Offer Count can be changed after enabling API management via the Content API. However, doing so could result in your API management status going from Active to Pending.
