# UET Tag

**What it is:**     The name of the UET tag that you added to your website to allow Microsoft Advertising to collect actions people take on your website.

**What you need to know:**     Conversion goals and remarketing lists use the same UET tag, so you only need to add one tag to your website.

**Tip:**     If you do have more than one UET tag, make sure you select the UET tag that you added to the webpage that is associated with this conversion goal or remarketing list.
