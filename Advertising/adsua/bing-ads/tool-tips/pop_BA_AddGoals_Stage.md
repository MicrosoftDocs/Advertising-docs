# Conversion step name

You need to create a goal for analytics to work and each goal requires at least one step. The conversion step is required and created by default but there are four types of steps:

- **Conversions:**  Tracks a transaction—such as a product purchase or an account sign-up—that a customer completes on your website. You can change the name, **Conversion step**, to something that makes sense to you.
- **Land:**  Tracks a visit to the site landing page that you want to lead to a conversion. A goal can have only one land step. Click **Add step**, and under type, select **Land**.
- **Browse:**  Tracks when a site visitor browses to a webpage with general information such as a list of products. A goal can have as many as five browse steps. Click **Add step**, and under type, select **Browse**.
- **Prospect:**  Tracks when a site visitor browses to a webpage that indicates they are getting close to a conversion. A goal can have as many as five prospect steps. Click **Add step**, and under type, select **Prospect**.
