**What it is** : With this goal, you can more accurately track purchases of a product as conversions for the ads shown for that product or a different product of the same brand.

**What you need to know** : To use this goal, you must have a Microsoft Merchant Center shopping campaign or other feed-based ad campaign. [What is Microsoft Merchant Center?](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBingMerchantCenter.md)

**Why it's important** : There are two ways product conversion goals can work:

- **Scenario 1: Standard product conversion goal** : A customer clicks an ad for Product A, navigates away without purchasing, subsequently clicks an ad for Product B, but ends up purchasing Product A. Normally, this conversion would be attributed to the ad for Product B. However, with the product conversion goal, you can track this as a conversion for the ad for Product A.
- **Scenario 2: Product conversion goal for brands** : A customer clicks an ad for Product A (Brand X), but ends up purchasing Product B (Brand X). Normally, no conversion would be reported. However, with the product conversion goal for brands, you can track this as a conversion for Brand X. You must have [Microsoft Shopping Campaigns for Brands](../hlp_BA_PROC_BMC_CoopBid.md) set up to use the product conversion goal for brands.
