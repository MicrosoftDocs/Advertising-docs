# Path

**What it is: **       A simplified webpage address that appears in your ads, similar to the display URL in text ads.

**What you need to know: **       The path is distinct from the final URL. The final URL is the actual webpage URL that customers are taken to after they click your ad. The path can be a shorter or "friendlier" version of your URL showing one or two subdirectories.

**Example: **       Let's say you sell men’s clothes, and you’re advertising shirts that are on sale for spring. While your final URL might be http://www.contoso.com/content/en/ clothesaccessories/spr2017/shirts, your path could simply be contoso.com/SpringSale/Shirts.

**Why it's important: **    It should give people a clear idea of where they will go when they click your ad.

**Note: **	   A path cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
