# Cost per acquisition (CPA)

**What it is: **       The total spend divided by conversions that are attributable to the ad. A conversion, or acquisition, is something that you want to happen after someone clicks your ad, 	   for example, purchasing a product or registering for your site.

**Why it's important: **       Although you cannot bid based on cost per acquisition, you can still track the cost of your conversions.
