# Values

A value is the dimension-related information you are tracking—such as a channel—and it is used in a URL query string to track the dimension. You can add a maximum of 100 values per dimension.

To define a value, in the **Values** box, enter the information you want to track, two asterisks (\*\*), and the value that represents the information.
