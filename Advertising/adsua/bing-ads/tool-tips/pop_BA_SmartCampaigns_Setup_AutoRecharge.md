# Recurring payments

**What it is: **With recurring payments (also called "auto-recharge"), we automatically add funds to your account when your prepaid balance gets low.

**Why it's important:** With prepay accounts, if you run out of money, your ads will stop running. Auto-recharge prevents this from happening.

**How it works:**  You set the recharge amount. Then each time your account balance reaches 20 percent of the amount, we will charge your primary payment method and add funds to your account.

**What you need to know:**  You'll need to have a credit or debit card as your primary payment method if you want to use auto-recharge. Checks, bank transfers, and other forms of offline payment won't work.
