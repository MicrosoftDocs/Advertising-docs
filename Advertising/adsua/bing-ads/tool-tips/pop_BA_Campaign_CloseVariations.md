# Exact match keyword options

**What it is:** Close variations of exact match keywords currently include minor grammatical variations such as plurals, abbreviations, acronyms, spacing and misspelling (U.S. only). So, for example, if your keyword is “motorcycle” then your ad is eligible to show for the search term “motorcycles.” 		(Other types of variations could be added in the future.)

**Why it's important:** If you want to broaden your results, then select **Use close variants**. If you want to narrow your results, then select **Use only my exact 		match keywords**.

**What you need to know:** Misspellings are currently included in exact match keywords regardless of whether you choose close variations or exact match.
