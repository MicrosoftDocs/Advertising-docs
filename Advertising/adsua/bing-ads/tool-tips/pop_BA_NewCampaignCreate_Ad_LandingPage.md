# Landing page

**What it is:**   It is the actual webpage people are taken to when they click your ad, which is different than the simplified URL ([display URL](../hlp_BA_DEFN_DisplayURL.md)) that is the webpage address that appears in your ad.

**How it works:**  The landing page includes both the specific webpage URL and (optionally) tracking parameters, which allows you to find out how people got to your website.

**What you need to know:**   There are two types:              **Destination URL**  is the old way of providing your landing page URL which  remains so that existing ads continue to work, and we recommend selecting final URL for any new landing pages. If you don't have URL tracking set up, you can continue to use destination URLs. If you use tracking, we suggest that you [upgrade your destination URLs to final URLs](../hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_MigrateFAQ.md).                   **Final URL**  is what we recommend selecting when creating a new landing page since it acts the same way as a destination URL but has the following enhancements. You can:
- Define a separate mobile URL if you have a website that is optimized for smaller devices.
- Separate the webpage URL from the tracking parameters so if you want to edit the parameters, you don't have to modify all your destination URLs. All you have to do is update the tracking template once and the changes apply across your account.
- Define custom parameters.
