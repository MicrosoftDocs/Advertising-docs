# Matches all

**What you need to know:**  "Matches all" operands will only return data that matches all of your search parameters.

**Example:**  If you filter on campaign names containing "holiday" and starting with "sale", your spreadsheet will only return data from campaign names that both contain "holiday" and start with "sale".

**Note:**  If you are querying your search parameters in the same way (for example, Contains, Equals, or Starts with), you can press Enter to input multiple parameters in the same field.
