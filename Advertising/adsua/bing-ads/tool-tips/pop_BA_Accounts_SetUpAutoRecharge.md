# Set up auto-recharge

**What it is:** Turn on auto-recharge to automatically add funds to your account when your prepaid balance gets low.

**Why it's important:**  With prepay accounts, if you run out of money, your ads stop running. Auto-recharge prevents this from happening.

**How it works:**  You set the recharge amount. Based on your average daily advertising spend, we calculate when your funds will run out, and charge the recharge amount to your primary payment method in time to keep your ads running.

**What you need to know:**  You need to have a credit or debit card as your primary payment method if you want to use auto-recharge. Checks, bank transfers, and other forms of offline payment won't work.
