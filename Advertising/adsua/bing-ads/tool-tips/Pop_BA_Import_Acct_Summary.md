# Summary

**What it is:**  A summary of how many items were imported successfully and how many had errors and were unsuccessful.

**What you need to know:**  If you click the ellipsis icon ![More information icon](../../images/BA_ScreenCap_DeliveryDetails.png), you will see what was added, updated, or had an error. For example, ad extensions might have 4 errors.
The update count reports all existing items that are fetched from Google Ads. It may be higher than the actual number of updates because it includes items that may not have been updated since the previous import.

Change history reports the actual number of updates in Microsoft Advertising. It may be lower than the update count as it excludes items that do not have updates.
