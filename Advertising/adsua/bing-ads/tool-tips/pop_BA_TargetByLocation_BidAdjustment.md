# Bid adjustments

With bid adjustments, you can increase (or decrease) your keyword bid for people in locations you target, which can help        [get your ads in front of the right people](../hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md).

For example,        let's say you are targeting New York state, but you know that your keyword        bid wonâ€™t be competitive in New York City. You can add the New York City metro        area as a target location and then add a bid adjustment.

Bid adjustments are a percentage increase on top of your keyword bid. You can increase bid adjustments        up to 900% and decrease them by as much as 90%.
