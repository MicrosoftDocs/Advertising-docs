# Currency

**What it is** : The currency for your account is what we use when we bill you. We also use this currency to show you bid and budget amounts across Microsoft Advertising.

**What you need to know** : You cannot change the currency for your account once it's set. So, if you want to be billed in a different currency, you will need to create another account. To run ads on social networks the currency in Microsoft Advertising must match the currency in your social network account.
