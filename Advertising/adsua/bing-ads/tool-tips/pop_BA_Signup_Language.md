# Language

This setting determines both the language of the Microsoft Advertising emails and interface (**display language**) and the language of the billing documents you receive from Microsoft Advertising (**billing language**).       After you sign up, you can change your display language or billing language at any time.

You'll select the language your ads are written in (**ad language**) when you create your first campaign.
