# Keyword insertion case

**What it is** : This is how you want your keyword text to be capitalized.

**What you need to know** : Here's how each case works:
- **Title case** : The first letter of all of the words in your keyword will be capitalized. For example, "Organic Coffee.”
- **Sentence case** : Only the first letter of the first word in your keyword will be capitalized. For example, "Organic coffee.”
- **Lower case** : No letters will be capitalized. For example, "organic coffee.”
