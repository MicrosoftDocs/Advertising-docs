# Audience status

**What it is** : The status of your audience targeting based on the total amount of people included in it as well as its associated UET tag.

**What you need to know** : If there are no issues, the status will be **Ready**. If the status is something else, take a look at [What's my audience targeting status?](../hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_AudienceStatus.md) for more information.
