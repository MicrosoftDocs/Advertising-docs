# Keyword distribution graph

This visualization tool helps you quickly find the keywords that are performing well, and those that arenâ€™t. To see how         the graph works, select one of the preset filters: low cost, high CTR, high CPC and low CTR, or zero clicks.

In addition to using the presets, you can adjust the sliders to the right of each graph to narrow down to a specific set of        keywords, for example, low impressions with a high click-through rate.

As you adjust the graph, the table shows you the relevant keywords so that you can take action to improve performance.
