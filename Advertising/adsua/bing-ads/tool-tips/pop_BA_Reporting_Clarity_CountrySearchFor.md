# Country/region (searching for)

**What it is:**    The name of a country if the user’s geographical intent can be determined. The country is set if the user’s intent is a country or sub geography of the country, and not necessarily if they are physically located in the country.

**Why it’s important:**    This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
