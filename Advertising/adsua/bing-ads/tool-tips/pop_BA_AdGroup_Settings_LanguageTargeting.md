# Language

**What it is** : This is the language of the websites you want your ads to appear on.

**What you need to know** : When the multiple campaign language targeting feature is enabled, your campaign languages will be set to the languages of all the ad groups. For example, if a campaign has three ad groups with language set to English, German, and French, then the campaign languages will be set to English, German, and French. You can subsequently change this setting. If you want the campaign to target multiple languages, you can update the ad groups, using the **Use the campaign settings** option. If all of the ad groups in a campaign are set to the same language, then enabling this feature will not affect the campaign’s language setting.
You can still have an ad-group-level language setting if you want the ad group to target one specific language. The ad group language, if set, will override the campaign settings. If there is no ad group language, then all the campaign languages will apply to the ad groups.

**Keep in mind** : Microsoft Advertising doesn’t translate your ads or keywords. It's a good idea to write your ads in the language you are targeting. If you choose to update your campaign or ad group languages at a later time, Microsoft Advertising does not copy ad group languages to campaigns. Please note that **Use my campaign settings** is only available for the ad group language when there are languages set on your campaign.
