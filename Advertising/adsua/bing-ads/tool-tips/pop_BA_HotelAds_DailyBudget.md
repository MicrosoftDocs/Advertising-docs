# Daily budget

**What it is:**  The maximum amount of money you want to spend per day. Your daily budget is a soft limit, meaning on certain days it may be exceeded. Your monthly budget, calculated by taking your daily budget and multiplying by the number of days in the month, is a hard limit which will not be exceeded.
