# Auto-recharge settings

To set up auto-recharge and avoid delays in delivering your ads, turn on the Auto-recharge settings toggle and then enter a recharge amount.

Each time your account balance reaches 20 percent of the recharge amount,        we will automatically charge your primary payment method and add funds to your account.

For more information, see [Add funds to a prepay account](../hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md).
