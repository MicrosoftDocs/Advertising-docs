# Estimated mainline bid

**What it is: **     Based on your campaign performance and marketplace dynamics, this estimate is the bid amount that Microsoft Advertising calculates will place your ad at the top of search results, also known as "mainline."

**What you need to know:**     These estimates are provided as a reference only. They are automatically generated by Microsoft Advertising and are not a guarantee of ad position.

**No estimates available:**     If you are not seeing estimates in the table, there might not be enough data to generate them. Check back later.
