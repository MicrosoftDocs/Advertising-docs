# Total visits

**What it is:**     A statistic that was used in a previous version of Universal Event Tracking (UET) that showed the total number of times customers visited your site.

**What you need to know:**  In the current version of UET, total visits is no longer supported and we plan to remove this metric from Microsoft Advertising reports in the future.
