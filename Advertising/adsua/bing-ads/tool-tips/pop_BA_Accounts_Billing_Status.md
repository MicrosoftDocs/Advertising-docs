# Status

**What it is:**     This describes the status of your invoice, which can be:
- **Open**, or awaiting payment
- **Overdue**, including the number of days overdue
- **Paid**

**What you need to know:**
- Status only applies to invoices. The status for all other billing documents will be a dash (**-**), which effectively means not applicable.
- Meant to help monthly invoice customers stay on top of their bills and to sort invoices, this column can be filtered for each status.
