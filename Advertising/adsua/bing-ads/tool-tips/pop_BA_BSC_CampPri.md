# Campaign priority

**What it is:**  Allows you to prioritize a particular campaign higher than another in the case where both campaigns include the same product.

**How to use:**  If you have a product that is included in more than one Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, you can choose which campaign should be the preferred campaign to display ads for that product. Set the preferred campaign's priority to "High" and the others to "Low." The campaign priority will override bids in cases where there are duplicate products.

**What you need to know:**  If multiple campaigns, which include duplicate products, have the same priority, bid once again is the determining factor.
