# Set as

**Primary payment method.**         Your primary payment method is used to pay your account charges. If you select this option and already have a primary payment method, it will be replaced with the one you are adding.

**Backup payment method.**        Your backup payment method will be used to pay your charges if something happens to your primary payment method (for example, your card expires). If you select this option and already have a backup payment method, it will be replaced with the one you are adding. If backup is unavailable, you need to set a primary payment method first and then you can set a backup.

**Just add it to my list of payment methods.**        You can just add the payment method to your list and use it as primary or backup later, as long as it is listed as an available payment method for your account.

> If primary and backup are unavailable, then you can't use the type of payment method that you are adding to pay for charges on this account. You can, however, add the payment method to your list so that you can use it with other accounts that accept that form of payment.
