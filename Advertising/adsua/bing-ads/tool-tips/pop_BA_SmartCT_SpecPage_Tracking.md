# Tracking

**What it is** : This setting determines whether or not you want to track detailed metrics for the pages listed here.

**What you need to know** :
- Microsoft Advertising tracks these pages for all your campaigns when tracking is turned on.
- You can pause tracking for any special page, which will pause tracking of the page for all campaigns. Note: You can still view the data we gathered prior to the point you paused tracking.
