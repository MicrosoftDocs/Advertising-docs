# Rate of visits to special pages

**What it is:**  The percentage of website visitors who visited your special pages after clicking your ad, during the selected date range. This is calculated by dividing the number of total visits by the total number of clicks. For example, if the ads in your campaign receive 100 clicks that lead to 10 visits to special pages, the rate of visits is 10%.

**What you need to know:**
- Data collection begins after you add your tracking tag to your website’s code.
- A zero displays if there's no data available for the selected date range—either because the selected date range is before you set up customer action tracking or because you received no traffic from your ad in this date range.
