# Import search and DSA mixed campaigns as search campaigns

**What it is:**    Mixed mode campaigns contain both dynamic search ads and other ad types (e.g., Expanded Text Ads). This option determines whether dynamic search ads or other ad types are imported.

**What you need to know:** If you're in a market where dynamic search ads are not yet supported by Microsoft Advertising we will only import other ad types into **Standard** ad groups. Once dynamic search ads are available in your market, we will import dynamic search ads into **Dynamic** ad groups and other ad types into **Standard** ad groups. Both ad group types will be created in search campaigns.
