# Promotional offer

**What it is** : Got a promotional offer? This is where you enter the code.

**Why it's important** : Microsoft Advertising occasionally runs promotional offers. Promotional offers require you to spend money on your advertising campaign first, and then we give you a credit toward free advertising. For example, you get $100 in free advertising when you spend $25.

**What you need to know:**

- You can enter your promotional code now or later (on the Payment Methods page).
- You must enter your billing information before you can redeem your promotional offer.
- Make sure that you understand the rules listed on your promotional offer (for example, expiration date).
