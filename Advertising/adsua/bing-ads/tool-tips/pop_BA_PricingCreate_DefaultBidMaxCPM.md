# Set bids

**What it is:**     Your bid is how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad.

**What you need to know:**     The default bid is used for all your keywords in this ad group unless you set a custom bid for a keyword, which you can do at any time.

**Why it's important:**     You bid on keywords to get your ads to show up on webpages that have a limited number of places to show ads. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. If your bid is not high enough, you might not get your desired placement, such as on the first page of search results.

**Example:**     If you sell shoes and bid on the keyword "shoe," you’ll have to beat the bids of the other shoe sellers who are also bidding on "shoe." If your bid is not high enough, you might not get the space you want, such as on the first page of search results.
