# Pause campaigns when all imported location targets are unsupported

**What it is**: When enabled, this option will pause campaigns in which all their location targets are unsupported by Microsoft Advertising.

**What you need to know**: If a campaign contains both supported **and** unsupported location targets, the campaign will not be paused, and will continue to serve for supported location targets.
