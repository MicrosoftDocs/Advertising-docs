# Maximum CPC

**What it is**: This is an optional setting. It's the maximum you're willing to pay for a click on your ad.

**What you need to know**:  With automated bidding strategies Microsoft Advertising sets your bids automatically. You can set a maximum CPC to make sure that Microsoft Advertising never charges more than a certain amount for each individual click. However, we recommend not setting a maximum CPC in order to get the most possible benefit from automated bidding.
