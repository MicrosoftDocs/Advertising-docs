# Redemption code

**What it is:** The code a customer enters for the promotion.

**What you need to know:**
- Redemption codes typically reflect the promotion, for example: EXTRA15OFF, BUY1GET2
- Redemption codes are optional. If you do not include a code, the promotion should automatically be included when the customer makes a purchase.
