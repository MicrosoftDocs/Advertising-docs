# Ad group performance trend

Performance trend graphs give you a visual way to review your accounts, campaigns, and ad groups.         You can quickly answer the question "How is my campaign doing?" Then you can focus on areas that need your attention the most.

You can compare performance between the selected time range and a comparison range:    previous period, same period last year, or moving average.    The comparison range answers the question "Is the performance trend data typical?"

If your accounts are in different currencies, you wonâ€™t see overall totals for performance metrics and budget data that provide financial information (for example, average CPC, spend, IO budget). If you do not see your performance metrics and budget data on the Accounts Summary page, please filter to one currency at a time.
