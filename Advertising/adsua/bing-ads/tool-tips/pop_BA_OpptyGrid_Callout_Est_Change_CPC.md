# Estimated change in avg. CPC

**What it is:**     The potential change in avg. cost per click each week when you add callout extensions to a suggested campaign.

**What you need to know:**     These estimations are based on performance data from the last 7 days and are not a guarantee of future performance. In the majority of cases, avg. cost per click is estimated without any change. Sometimes, however, you may notice that the estimated average cost per click may be slightly higher than before. This is due to adding callout extensions which are estimated to increase clicks and click-through rate on higher positions that usually have a higher cost per click.
