# Schedule Name

**What it is:**  This is a friendly label for this scheduled import to help you distinguish it from other scheduled imports.

**What you need to know:**  As a best practice, you should use a schedule name that helps describe the catalog, but beware: you can't use the same schedule name if you have multiple scheduled imports.
