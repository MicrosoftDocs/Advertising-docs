# Current balance

**What it is: **    Current balance is the amount you owe on this postpay threshold account. The balance will be paid when you reach your billing threshold or monthly billing date, whichever comes first.

**What you need to know: **

- There can be a delay of up to 4 hours between the time someone clicks your ad and the time the charge appears in this column.
- The amount does not include estimated VAT/tax (where applicable).
- Filtering the table does not affect the amount shown here.
