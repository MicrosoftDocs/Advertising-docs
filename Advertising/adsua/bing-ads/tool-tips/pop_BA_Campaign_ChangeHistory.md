# Change history graph

To understand how changes affect your campaign, use the change history graph.
- The blue line represents the metric you are interested in (clicks by default). Look for valleys or peaks          in the line to indicate significant changes that might be worth investigating.
- The markers represent number of changes made on a particular date.          Hover over the marker to get more info. Click the marker to narrow down the change history data shown in the table.
- You can also narrow down results by change types or date range.

Change history data is only available for the previous six months.
