# Average position

**What it is:** The average position on the web page for ads that were delivered. Although it varies, positions 1-4 appear at the top of the search results page and positions 5-10 appear in other locations (for example, the bottom or the sidebar).

**Why itâ€™s important:** Use this to compare your ad position with the average rank of all ads in the auction.

**Tip:** Look at average position on the **Keywords** table to identify where to adjust your bids to move your ads into the best position.
