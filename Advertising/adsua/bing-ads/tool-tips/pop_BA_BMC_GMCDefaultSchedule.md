# Default schedule

**What it is:**  Set when the import was first created, this is the default recurrence for when your catalogs are imported from Google Merchant Center.

**What you need to know:**  Let's say you have four catalogs in one import. You can apply the default schedule to all four catalogs so that they're imported at the same time. Or, you can customize the schedule of each catalog within that one import by removing the default schedule and selecting a new recurrence for each.
