# Account time zone

**What it is:**  The **Account time zone** is the default time zone for all of your campaigns. If you change your account time zone, the time zone for all campaigns will automatically switch to your new time zone.

**What it isn't:**  Account time zone does not affect your billing. Billing is based on Pacific Time for all customers.

**Tip:** Most people select the time zone of their business location.
