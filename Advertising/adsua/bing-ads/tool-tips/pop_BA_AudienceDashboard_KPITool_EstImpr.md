**Why it's important**: Regardless of whether you are driving customers to your website, tracking conversions, or just trying to get your message out, youâ€™ll want to track the number of times your ad is shown.

**Note**: This estimate is based on the budget and bid you set above, and is provided as a reference only. It is automatically generated by Microsoft Advertising and is not a guarantee of future performance. Your actual results may vary based on your targeting, budget, bid, and other settings.
