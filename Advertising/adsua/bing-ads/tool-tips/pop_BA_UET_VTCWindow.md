# View-through conversion window

**What it is** : The view-through conversion window is the length of time after an impression that you want to track view-through conversions.

**What you need to know** : View-through conversions are conversions that people make after they have seen your ad, even though they did not click the ad.

**Keep in mind** : A shorter window will reduce the number of conversions your account records.
