# Target specific webpages

If you select this option, you can target specific pages of your website based on their URL, category, page title, or page content.

**Why it's important:**  This option lets you:
- Set different bids for different parts of your website.
- Make sure youâ€™re not targeting parts of your website that are not relevant to your campaign goal.
