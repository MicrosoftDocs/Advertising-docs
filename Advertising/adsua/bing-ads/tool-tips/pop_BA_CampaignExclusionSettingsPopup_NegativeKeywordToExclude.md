# Keywords to exclude

Add negative keywords if you want to prevent your ads from appearing when people search for a certain word or phrase.

For example, if you sell hair-styling mousse, you might want to add “chocolate mousse” as a negative keyword.

> Make sure that the words you are adding as negative keywords are not included in your keyword list.

Not sure if you should add to a campaign or ad group? See [Learn about using negative keywords to get to the right customers](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutNegativeKeywords.md).
