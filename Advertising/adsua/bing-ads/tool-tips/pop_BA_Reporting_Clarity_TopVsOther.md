# Top vs. other

**What it is: **  The position (mainline, sidebar, or bottom of the page) of your ad on a Bing, AOL or Yahoo search results page.

**Why itâ€™s important: **  This data shows which keywords cause your ads to appear in the mainline (top) or sidebar or bottom of the page (other) position on search result pages. You will also see the return on investment (ROI) difference between the two positions for a given keyword. Use this insight to guide your bid decisions on keywords.
