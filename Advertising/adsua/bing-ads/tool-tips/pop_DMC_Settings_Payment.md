# Payment method and billing

**What it is:**
- To pay for search advertising in Microsoft Advertising, you must have a credit or debit card as your primary payment method.
- You accrue costs every time your ad is clicked. In Microsoft Advertising, you're automatically charged on your monthly billing date, or when you reach a preset amount (known as your billing threshold), whichever comes first.

**What you need to know:**
- Microsoft Advertising accepts credit and debit cards only (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Network). We do not accept payments by prepaid cards.
- Your billing threshold is a set amount that triggers billing for advertising costs.
- Any advertising spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook.
