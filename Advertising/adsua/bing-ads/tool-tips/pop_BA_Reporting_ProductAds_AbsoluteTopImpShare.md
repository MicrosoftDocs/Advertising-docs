# Absolute top impression share (%)

**What it is:**  The estimated percentage of times your ad was in the first position of all results, out of the total impressions available in the market you were targeting.

**Why it's important:**  Impression share data gives clues about how many impressions you might be missing in the top slot and why. This data can inform you about making changes to get more impressions and clicks on those ads.
