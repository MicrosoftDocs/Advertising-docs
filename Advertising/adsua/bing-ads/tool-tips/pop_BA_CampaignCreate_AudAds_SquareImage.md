# Square image

**What it is** : This is one of two possible aspect ratios for images that could appear in your audience ads.

**Why it's important** : Because audience ads are responsive, we require multiple images so they can flexibly display across a variety of publishers and placements.

**What you need to know** : Square images have an aspect ratio of 1:1. You can crop an image to this aspect ratio when you add it.

Click **Add** to add a new or existing image or **Edit** to make changes to an image you've previously selected.

The requirements for adding an image are:
- **Accepted file types for images:** JPEG, PNG, and GIF (without animation)
- **Minimum image dimensions:** 760 x 400 pixels
- **Maximum image dimensions:** 2592 x 2048 pixels
- **Recommended square image dimensions:** 1200 x 1200 pixels
