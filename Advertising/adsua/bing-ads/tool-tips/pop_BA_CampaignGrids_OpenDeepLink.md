# Opens to deep link

**What it is:**     The number of times a user clicks on your ad and is directed to a specific page, or deep link, within your app.

**Why it's important:**     This number shows how many people have your app installed so you can judge how effective your ad is in engaging existing customers.

**Tip:**     When you add the deep link URL and app store URL numbers, you get the total clicks on your ad.
