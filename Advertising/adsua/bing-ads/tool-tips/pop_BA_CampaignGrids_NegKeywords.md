# Negative keywords

**What it is:**        Words and phrases that you don’t want to trigger your ad. For example, if you sell fine chocolates, you might want to add the popular dog breed “chocolate Labrador” as a negative keyword.

**Why it's important:**        By filtering out impressions shown to people who won’t be interested in your ad, you can increase your click-through rate.
