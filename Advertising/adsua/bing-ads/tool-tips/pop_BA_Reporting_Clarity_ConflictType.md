# Conflict type

**What it is** : The type of negative keyword conflict encountered.

**What you need to know** : Some advertisers intentionally create negative keyword conflicts to block a portion of match type traffic.
There are two possible conflict types:

- **Possibly intentional** : The text of the keyword, after normalization (e.g., punctuation and capitalization removed), and the negative keyword are identical, and the match type of the negative keyword is more restrictive than the match type of the keyword (e.g., Keyword is phrase match, negative keyword is exact match).
- **True** : Any other negative keyword conflict.

**Why it's important** : If you are an advertiser who employs the strategy of intentionally blocking a portion of match type traffic, you can use this column to filter out intentional negative keyword conflicts. If you're not, you should investigate and fix both types of conflicts.
