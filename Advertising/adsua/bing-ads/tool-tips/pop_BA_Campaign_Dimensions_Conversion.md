# Conversion goals dimension

This dimension, which is only available if you have [conversion tracking](../hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2WhatIsCT.md) enabled, gives you performance information    for your predefined conversion goals. Use this to track goals, such as a purchase, a registration, or whatever you    consider is the best measure of your ads success. (Read more [about the Dimensions tab](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutDimensionsTab.md).)
