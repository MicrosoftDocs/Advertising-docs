# Description

**What it is** : This column applies to campaigns that have enabled dynamic search ad text. This is the dynamic search ad text we automatically generated in addition to the ad text you provided. During ad delivery, we use AI to choose the best ad text available from these options. We are only able to provide the top descriptions being served.

**What you need to know** : Ad text includes a description of the products and services as well as a call to action. When you create your dynamic search ad, you provide the **Ad text** and, optionally, **Ad text 2**. For campaigns that have enabled Dynamic search ad text, please keep in mind that we also created ad text for you and will determine the best available description during ad delivery.
