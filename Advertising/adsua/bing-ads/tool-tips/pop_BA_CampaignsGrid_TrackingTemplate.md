# Tracking template

**What it is:**  A template where you define URL tracking for you ads. You enter either of these items:
- {lpurl} followed by URL parameters and custom parameters which are separated by an ampersand (&amp;). For example, {lpurl}?matchtype={matchtype}&amp;device={device}
- The URL you received from a third-party tracking tool or service. For example, http://www.trackingc.com/?url={lpurl}&amp;id=5

**Why it's important:**   When your ad is served, the tracking information is dynamically appended to your landing page URL.

**What you need to know:**  You can add a tracking template to your Account > Campaign > Ad group > Ad > Keyword > Ad extension (highest to lowest level). When your ad is served, the tracking template at the lowest level is used.
