# Estimated conversions

**What it is:**     The estimated number of conversions, which are the clicks that results in a sale or another measure of success, to a particular age group or gender. Conversions are measured by adding a small bit of code to your website pages which tracks a visitorâ€™s progress through your site.

**What you need to know:**     This value is an estimate because age and gender are not known for the entire audience.
