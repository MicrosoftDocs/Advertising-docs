# Decrease current bids

**What it is: **       Decrease the current bids for selected keywords by a percentage or fixed amount.

**What you need to know: **       If you add a minimum bid amount, none of your bids will go below that amount, except bids that were already less than the minimum.

**Example: **       You have three keywords with different bids: $3, $7, and $10. You decrease the current bid for these keywords by 50% and set the minimum bid to $4. Your first bid stays the same ($3), because it is lower than the minimum bid. Your second bid is $4, and your third bid is $5.
