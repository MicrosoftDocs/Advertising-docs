# Goals

After you enable analytics, the next step is to create a goal, which is simply a specific bit of information that you want to track when analyzing the success of your campaign. For example, you can track how many people click on your ad actually:

- Make a purchase
- Sign up for a newsletter
- Create an account
- Access a list of products on your webpage

If you do not create a goal, analytics will not work. After you click **Create goal**,  follow the on-screen instructions on the **Create goal** page.
