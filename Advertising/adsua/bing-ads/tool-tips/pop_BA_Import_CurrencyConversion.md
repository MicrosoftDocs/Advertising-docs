# Convert bids and budgets to your Microsoft Advertising account currency upon import

**      What it is:**     When enabled, this option fetches bids and budgets data from Google Ads and converts it the currency you set in Microsoft Advertising.

**What you need to know:**     This option is only available when there is a currency mismatch between your Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising accounts. Existing currencies in Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising will not be affected.

**      Note:**     If you set up an account and need to [change the currency](../hlp_BA_CONC_Currency.md), you will need to set up a new account. If you have campaigns, ad groups, ads, and settings in the old account, then you will want to export them from the old account and import them into the new one.
