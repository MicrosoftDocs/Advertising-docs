# Keyword Competition

Keyword competition is an indicator of how many advertisers are bidding on a particular keyword. Highly competitive keywords are more popular among advertisers and, therefore, tend to require larger bids to get the better ad positions. Keywords with medium or low competition might offer advertisers a better ROI.
