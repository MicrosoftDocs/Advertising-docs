# Currency

**What it is:** The currency for your account is what we use when we bill you. We also use this currency to show you bid and budget amounts across Microsoft Advertising.

**What you need to know:**  Payment methods vary by currency and country/region. To review the full list of payment methods, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](../hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).

> You cannot change the currency for your account once it's set. So, if you want to be billed in a different currency, you will need to [create another account](../hlp_BA_PROC_CreateAcctSelfServe.md).
