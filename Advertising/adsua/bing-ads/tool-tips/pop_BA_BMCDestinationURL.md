# Destination URL

**What it is:**  The destination URL is the web page people are directed to when they click your ad. This URL should match the URL claimed in the Bing Webmaster Tools or an existing Universal Event Tracking (UET) tag tied to the domain.

**What you need to know:**  The product link URL provided in your feed should have the same domain as the destination URL.
