# Countdown time zone

**What it is** : Here you choose whether to base your countdown's end date and time on your account's time zone or on the ad viewer's time zone.

**Why it's important** : If you're advertising, for example, in-store sales at locations in several time zones, you'll probably want to use the ad viewer's time zone. But if you have an online sale that you want to end at a specific time, you'll want to use your account's time zone.
