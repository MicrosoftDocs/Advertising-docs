# Descriptions

**What it is:**  The descriptions that are shown below the path in your ad. To maximize impressions across all ad formats, the descriptions might not always be shown in your ad.

**Why it's important:**  You can have up to four descriptions, with each description containing up to 90 characters each. A maximum of two descriptions will be chosen when your ad is served. You have more character space to work with in the description than in the headline. So once the headline has someone’s attention, the description needs to convince them to click it.

**Note** : Descriptions cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
