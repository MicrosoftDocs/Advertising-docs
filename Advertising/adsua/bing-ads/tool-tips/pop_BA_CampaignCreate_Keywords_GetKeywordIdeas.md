# Get keyword ideas

**What it is:**        You can use this to get suggestions for keywords appropriate for your campaign.

**How it works:**

- Enter either a relevant word or your website's URL and click the search button.
- Keyword suggestions will appear below.
- For each suggested keyword, you'll see how many times people search on it every month, what its average cost per click (CPC) is, and how competitive this keyword is.
- Click the arrows by a keyword to move it over into the **Enter keywords** box.

**Note** : Keyword suggestions are currently supported for English-, French-, and German-language campaigns that are targeted to locations within the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Germany. If your campaign is global, then the suggestions are based on only these locations.
