# Personalized promotions

**What it is** :  These allow you to offer cashback discounts and coupon discounts to potential customers per campaign and ad group. In order to offer cashback discounts, you must ensure that your UET tag is tracking product purchase events. For more information, see [Example custom events for e-commerce customers](../hlp_BA_PROC_UET_ExampleEventsEcommerce.md) and select the **Order confirmation** page heading.

**What you need to know** : These will appear as ad decorations to potential customers. During the checkout experience, we will prompt your customers to enroll in Microsoft Rewards in order to redeem their cashback offer if they are not yet enrolled.

All campaigns with personalized promotions use automated bidding. This means that enabling Personalized promotions automatically sets your **Bid strategy** to Maximize Conversion Value (automated bidding). Automated bidding allows Microsoft Advertising to optimize your Personalized promotions based on your campaign goals and budget.
