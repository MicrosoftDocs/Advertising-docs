# Account errors

**What it is:**     When an account has an error, the ads in that account are not running.

**What you need to know:**     In some cases, you can fix the error yourself, and in other cases, you'll need to contact us. If you see an error in this column, click the ellipsis icon ![ellipsis icon](../../images/BA_ScreenCap_DeliveryDetails.png) for more information on what the error is and what to do next to fix it.

**Tip:** 	You can filter the different types of errors if you want to find (or hide) a particular account with issues.
