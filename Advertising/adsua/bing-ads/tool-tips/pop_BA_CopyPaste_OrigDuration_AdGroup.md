# Use original duration

**What it is** : Select this if you want the ads in the ad group you're pasting to run for the same length of time as in the original ad group.

**For example** : Let's say the original ad group had a start date of May 10 and an end date of May 30 of the same year. If you give the copied ad group a start date of August 2 and select **Use original duration**, then the ads will stop running after 20 days, on August 22.
