**What it is** : This is the average return on ad spend (revenue divided by spend) you'd like to receive.

**What you need to know** : With the Target ROAS bid strategy, Microsoft Advertising sets your bids automatically to get the most conversions possible within your budget. Some conversions may cost more than your target and some may cost less, but Microsoft Advertising will try to make sure your average return on ad spend is in line with your target.
