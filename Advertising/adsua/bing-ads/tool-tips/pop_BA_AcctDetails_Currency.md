# Currency

The currency for your account is what we use when we bill you and when we show you bid and budget amounts across Microsoft Advertising.

In a few cases, the currency you choose can impact the payment methods you can use to pay for your account. To read about those restrictions,         see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](../hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).

> You cannot change the currency for your account, so if you want to be billed in a different currency,         you will need to [Add an additional account](../hlp_BA_PROC_CreateAcctSelfServe.md)
