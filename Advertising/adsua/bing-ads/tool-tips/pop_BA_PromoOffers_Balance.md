# Remaining balance

**What it is:** This is the amount of future advertising left to spend.

**What you need to know:**

- Promotional offers cannot be refunded. If your offer expires, you forfeit any remaining balance.
- Once your remaining balance reaches zero, your ads will continue to run, and we’ll charge your primary payment method (postpay threshold account) or deduct funds (prepay account). If you have a prepay account and no funds are available, we’ll pause the account.
