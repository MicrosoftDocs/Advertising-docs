# Click-through rate (CTR)

**What it is:** The number of clicks that your ad might receive divided by the number of times your ad might be shown. For example, if your ads have 50 clicks out of 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13%.

**What you should know:** CTR is a good way to quickly judge the effectiveness of your ad copy.
