# Target recommended categories

**What it is:** If you select this option, Microsoft Advertising will analyze your website and then categorize its content. You can then select which categories you want to target.

**Note:** If this option is not available, we haven't generated categories that apply to your website's content yet.

**Why it's important:** With this option, you can:
- Keep the dynamic search ads focused on a particular theme.
- Set different bids for different parts of your website.
- Make sure youâ€™re not targeting parts of your website that are not relevant to your campaign goal.
