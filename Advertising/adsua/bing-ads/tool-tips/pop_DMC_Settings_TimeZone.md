# Time zone

**What it is:**  The time zone that your campaign is associated with. By default, a campaign inherits its account's time zone setting.

**What you need to know** : You cannot change the time zone for your account once it's set. To run ads on social networks the time zone in Microsoft Advertising must match the time zone in your social network account.
