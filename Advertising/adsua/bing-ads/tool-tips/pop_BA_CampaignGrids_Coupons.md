# Coupons

**What it is** : Personalized coupons allow you to offer coupon discounts to potential customers per campaign and ad group.

**Why it's important** : Personalized coupons are only available for ad groups within shopping campaigns. Choose from one of these options to adjust your personalized coupons for the ad group:

- **Inherit from campaign (Enable)** allows your ad group to inherit your campaign’s **Coupons** setting. You will see this option if your campaign has enabled personalized coupons.
- **Inherit from campaign (Disable)** allows your ad group to inherit your campaign’s **Coupons** setting. You will see this option if your campaign has disabled personalized coupons.
- **Enable**. This option enables personalized coupons for your ad group.
- **Disable**. This option disables personalized coupons for your ad group.

**What you need to know** : In order to offer personalized coupons, you must first create a promotion with Merchant Promotions. [Learn more about Merchant Promotions](../hlp_BA_CONC_BMC_MerchantPromo.md)
