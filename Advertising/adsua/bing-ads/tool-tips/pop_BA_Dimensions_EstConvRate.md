# Estimated conversion rate (%)

**What it is:**     The estimated number of the conversions that results in a sale or another measure of success to a particular age group or gender, divided by the estimated number of clicks by a particular age group or gender.

**What you need to know:**     This value is an estimate because the age and gender is not known for the entire audience.
