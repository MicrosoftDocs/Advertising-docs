# Tax ID

When you create an account in New Taiwan Dollars (TWD), we ask you for your Tax ID number.

You are not required to provide your Tax ID. However, if you are using Microsoft Advertising in Taiwan but do not provide a Tax ID, you may not be able to report receipts and invoices from Microsoft Advertising when filing your taxes. Check your local tax laws to be sure of your responsibilities.
