# Top of page CPC

**What it is: ** The total cost of all clicks on an ad that showed up above the organic search results divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount an advertiser is charged each time their ad is clicked. For example, if an advertiser paid a total of $48.35 for 300 clicks, the advertiser's average CPC is $0.16.

**Why important:** You use this information to help you decide if you want to increase your keyword bid to improve the chance that your ad will show up above the organic search results.
