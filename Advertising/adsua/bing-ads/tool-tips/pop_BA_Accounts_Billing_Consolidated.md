# Consolidated billing

**What it is:**     With consolidated billing, you can get your monthly invoices combined into a single bill for simplified accounting.

**What you need to know:** You can only consolidate bills that share the same characteristics, such as the same Microsoft Advertising manager account number, currency, language, and SAP ID. At this time, you only have the options to consolidate all monthly invoice bills or none.
