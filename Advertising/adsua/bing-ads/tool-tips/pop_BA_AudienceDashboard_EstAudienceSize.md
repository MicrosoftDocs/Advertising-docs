# Estimated monthly audience size

**What it is** : This is an estimate of how many people (on a monthly basis) match your settings in the left panel.

**Why it's important** : This is **not** equivalent to the number of people your campaign will reach, but it's a handy snapshot of the total possible pool of people in this audience.

**Note** : This is an estimated figure and does not guarantee future results.
