# Import changes to existing items

When importing your campaigns, there are a lot of different pieces of information that get imported. Whether this is your first time or you’re re-importing an existing campaign, it’s important to keep track of all the items that are either transferred or updated, and which ones are simply left untouched. Choose **Import changes to existing items** to import items that you have imported previously to Microsoft Advertising. If you've made changes to these items in Google Ads (or in a spreadsheet if you're importing from a file), we'll sync those changes with the items in Microsoft Advertising.

You can choose to only import certain changes to existing items. For example, if you're happy with your current bids and budgets for your items in Microsoft Advertising and don't want to import changes to your bids and budgets, clear both **Campaign budgets** and **Ad group and keyword bids**.
