# Language

**What it is** : This is the language of the websites you want your ads to appear on.

**What you need to know** : If you remove language targeting at the ad-group level, the ad group will use its campaign's language targeting setting.

**Keep in mind** : Microsoft Advertising doesn’t translate your ads or keywords. It's a good idea to write your ads in the language you are targeting.
