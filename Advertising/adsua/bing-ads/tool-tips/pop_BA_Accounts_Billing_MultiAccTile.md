# Summary information

**What it is:**     If you have more than one account, we summarize your account information at the top of the page, based on payment setting (postpay vs. prepay) and currency.
- **Postpay amount due**  is the total of all balances and amounts due (including VAT/tax, where applicable) for your postpay threshold and invoiced accounts.
- **Prepay balance**  is the total of all available funds for your prepay accounts.

**Example:** 	If you have three postpay accounts billed in US dollar, two postpay accounts billed in Euro, and one prepay account billed in Norwegian krone, youâ€™ll see three separate summaries at the top of this page.

**What you need to know:**
- Filtering the table does not affect the amounts shown in the summaries.
- If you have more summaries than can be displayed at one time, you can scroll left and right.
