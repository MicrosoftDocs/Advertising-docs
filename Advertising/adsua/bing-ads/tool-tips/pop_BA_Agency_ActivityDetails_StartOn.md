# Start date

**What it is:**  The start date is the date the agency wants to start managing your account. The options are **Immediately** or a specific date.

**What you need to know:**

- **Immediately** means that they will be able to manage your account as soon as you accept the request.
- If they chose a date in the future, they won’t be able to manage your account until that date, even if you accept the request today.
- If you do not accept the request within 30 days, it will be automatically declined.
