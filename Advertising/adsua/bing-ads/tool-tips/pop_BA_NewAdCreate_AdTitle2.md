# Ad title 2

**What it is: **       Ad title 2 comes after ad title 1, will appear separated by a vertical bar (|).

**What you need to know: **       With Expanded Text Ads, **Ad title 1** and **Ad title 2** will both appear in your ad. Each can be up to 30 characters long and will appear separated by a vertical bar (|).

**Tip: **       The most obvious way to call someoneâ€™s attention to your ad is to include keywords in your ad title. You can do this manually or by using dynamic text.

**Using dynamic text in ad titles: **    Dynamic text is a word, phrase, or other information that is inserted into the ad title or text. Use the {KeyWord} variable to insert keywords in your ads that match, or closely match, the text that a customer typed. By using {KeyWord} in your ad title and text, Microsoft Advertising automatically inserts your keyword into the ad when that ad is displayed.

**Note: **	   An ad title cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
