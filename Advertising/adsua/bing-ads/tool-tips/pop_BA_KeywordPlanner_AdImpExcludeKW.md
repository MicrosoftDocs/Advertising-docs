# Ad impression share (exclude keywords)

**What it is:** Your ad impression share is calculated over the last calendar month for the keyword ideas shown below, which don’t include keywords in your account. If your ad impression share is higher than zero, your match types may be causing your ads to show on related keywords that aren’t in your account.

**What you should know:** If you’d like your ad impression share to exclude keywords from your account, click "Keyword options" on the left. Then, turn off “Show keywords in my account.”
