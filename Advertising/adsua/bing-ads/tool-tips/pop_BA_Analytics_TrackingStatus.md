# Analytics status

Enable analytics to track how many people who click on your ad actually make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter, create an account, or do something else that is of interest to you. You complete several tasks on different screens to set this up:

- **Enable analytic status:**  If the analytic status is disabled, click **Edit** to enable it.
- **Create goals:**  A goal is simply the info that you want to track. Each goal requires at least one step and you create steps on the **Create goal** page.
- **Update your webpage:**  After you create your goal, add the code to the webpage that you want to track.
- **Run reports:**  After you finish these steps, the **Conversions report** and **Goals report** are available to you.
