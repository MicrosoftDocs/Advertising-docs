# People searching for or viewing pages about your targeted locations

**What it is:**      By selecting this option, your ads will show to people outside of your area who search for or view webpages about your targeted location.

**Example:**      You offer a city tour of Denver and want to target tourists planning a trip to the city, but don't want to target people living in Denver.

**Note:**      You can select both options to have your ads appear to people in, searching for, or viewing pages about your targeted locations.
