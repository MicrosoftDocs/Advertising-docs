# Start date

**What it is:**  The start date is the date that you want to start managing billing and payment for the account. You can select **Immediately** (pending any required approval), or you can pick a specific date.

**What you need to know:**

- If you're linking to someone else's account and are requesting to take over billing, the account owner has 30 days to approve your request.
- No approval is required if you're the account owner or are already linked to manage this account.
- Dates are based on the account's time zone.
