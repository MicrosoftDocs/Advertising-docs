# Promotion type

**What it is:**  The type of promotion you are offering.

**What you need to know:**  You can select the promotion type from the available list: Special Offer, Weekly Deals, Halloween, Black Friday, Christmas, or New Year. This is an optional field that can be used instead of a special offer on the ad, while displaying the promotion.
