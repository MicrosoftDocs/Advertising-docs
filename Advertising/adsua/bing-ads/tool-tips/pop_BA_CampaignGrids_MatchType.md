# Match type

**What it is:**        Match type determines how closely a search matches your keyword. The match types are broad, phrase, and exact. The same keyword can have different match types, each with a different bid amount.

**Why it's important:**        You can use match type to show your ad more broadly or more precisely, which can impact your return on investment.

**What you should know:**        For negative keywords, you can only use phrase and exact match types.
