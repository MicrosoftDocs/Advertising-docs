# Count

**What it is:**   This determines how your conversions are recorded within your chosen conversion window. There are two choices:

- **All conversions:**     All conversions that happen after an ad click will be counted. (Common choice for sales.)
- **Unique conversions:**     Only one conversion that happens after an ad click will be counted. (Common choice for leads.)

Note: For smart goals, this value displays as a dash (-) because it's not applicable. [Learn more about smart goals](../hlp_BA_CONC_SmartGoals.md)

**Example:**     You track two conversions: leads and sales. You pick "Unique” for leads and “All” for sales. When one ad click turns into two leads and two sales, it's counted as three conversions: one for the unique lead, and two for all the sales.
