# Daily budget options

- **Daily standard budget:**  Spend roughly the same amount every day so that you don’t run out of budget early in the month. Your daily standard budget is based on an estimated monthly budget (your daily standard budget x number of days in the month). Variations in your       daily budget will occur; however, you will not exceed the estimated monthly budget.
- **Shared-standard budget:**  Multiple campaigns use a shared budget. Microsoft Advertising will help you spend for optimized performance based on the products or services targeted by your campaigns and availability of corresponding user searches during the day.
