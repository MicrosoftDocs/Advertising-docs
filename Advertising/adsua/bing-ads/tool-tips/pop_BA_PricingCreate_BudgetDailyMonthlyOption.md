# Daily budget options

- **Daily standard budget:** Spend roughly the same amount every day so that you donâ€™t run out of budget early in the month. Your daily standard budget is based on an estimated monthly budget (your daily standard budget x number of days in the month). Variations in your       daily budget will occur; however, you will not exceed the estimated monthly budget.
- **Shared-standard budget:** Multiple campaigns use a shared budget. Microsoft Advertising will help you spend for optimized performance based on the products or services targeted by your campaigns and availability of corresponding user searches during the day.
