# Bid adjustment

**What it is** : You can increase your        bid to improve the chance that your ad will display to people searching on a desktop computer (including laptops), tablet, or smartphone.

**Example** : If your best customers typically search for products on a tablet, you could increase your bid for tablets by 30%.

**What you need to know** : Bid adjustments by device type can be anywhere from -100% to +900%.
