# Bounce rate

**What it is: **   A statistic that was used in a previous version of Universal Event Tracking (UET) that showed the percentage of customers to your website that only view one page (the landing page) and then leave your website.

**What you need to know: ** In the current version of UET, the bounce rate is no longer supported and we plan to remove this metric from Microsoft Advertising reports in the future.
