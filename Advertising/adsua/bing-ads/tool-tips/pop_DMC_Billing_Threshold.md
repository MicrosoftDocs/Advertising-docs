# Billing threshold

**What it is:** A set amount that triggers billing for advertising costs. We charge your primary payment method when you reach your billing threshold or your monthly billing date, whichever comes first.

**What you need to know:**
- **This is important:** Your billing threshold isnâ€™t the same as setting your budget. When you create an advertising campaign, you set your budget to tell us the limit you want to spend per day on your ad campaign.
- Microsoft Advertising determines your billing threshold, which starts out low and automatically increases when you make successful payments.
- If you run into problems paying your charges, Microsoft Advertising automatically decreases your billing threshold.
