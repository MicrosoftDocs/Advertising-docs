# Scheduling

**What it is** : This makes the other attributes in this feed item only apply during certain periods of times on certain days of the week.

**Example** : If you wanted this feed item to be applied from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Mondays, you would enter "Monday, 09:00 AM - 05:00 PM". If you want it to be applied on multiple days, separate the days with a semicolon, as in: "Monday, 09:00 AM - 05:00 PM; Tuesday, 09:00 AM - 05:00 PM".

**Note** : The time is based on your account's time zone setting.
