# Conversion window

**What it is:**   The conversion window is the length of time after a click that you want to track conversions.

Note: For smart goals, this value displays as a dash (-) because it's not applicable. [Learn more about smart goals](../hlp_BA_CONC_SmartGoals.md)

**What it means:**     If you pick 30 days, then conversions that happen within 30 days after a click are tracked. Past conversions aren't affected.

**Keep in mind:**     A shorter conversion window will reduce the number of conversions your account records.
