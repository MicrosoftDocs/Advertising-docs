# Average cost per mille (CPM)

**What it is:**        The total advertising cost divided by the number of impressions (in thousands). In Latin, mille means a thousand. Also, sometimes called average cost per thousand (CPT).

**What you need to know:**        This is a standard advertising industry performance metric that we calculate based on your spend and number of impressions.

**Why it’s important:** The goal of CPM-based ad budgeting is to build awareness of your brand to large audiences. CPM tells you how much it costs to get an ad to the type of users you’re targeting.
