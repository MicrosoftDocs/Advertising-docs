# Average cost per impressions (CPM)

**What it is:**        With manual cost per thousand impressions (CPM) bids, you set the actual cost you want to pay per 1,000 viewed impressions.

**What you need to know:**        A viewed impression is counted when more than 50% of the ad pixels are in user’s view and the ad is viewed for at least second.

**Why it’s important:** The goal of CPM-based ad budgeting is to build awareness of your brand to large audiences. CPM tells you how much it costs to get an ad to the type of users you’re targeting.
