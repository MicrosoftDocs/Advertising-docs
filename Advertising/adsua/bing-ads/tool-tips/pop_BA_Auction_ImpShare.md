# Impression share

**What it is:**  The number of times an ad is shown on the Microsoft Search Network divided by the total available impressions.

**Why itâ€™s important:**  Use this to compare your share of impressions to the impression share of advertisers competing against you.

**Tip:**  If your impressions are decreasing, run an **Account**, **Campaign**, **Ad group** or **Share of voice** performance report and review the **Impression share lost to** columns to see what adjustments you can make.
