# Clicks

**What it is:**   Clicks are what an advertiser pays for. They typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page on the Microsoft Search Network or on a site on the Microsoft Audience Network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for examples, spiders, robots, test servers).

**Why it's important:**  When researching if you should add new keywords, you can see what keywords are generating the most clicks.
