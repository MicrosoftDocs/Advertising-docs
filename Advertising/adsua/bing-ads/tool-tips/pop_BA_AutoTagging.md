# Auto-tagging

**What it is:**     Microsoft Advertising automatically adds several types of UTM (urchin tracking module) tags to the final URLs of your text ads, keywords, Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, Image Extensions, and Sitelink Extensions. Microsoft Advertising adds these UTM tags: utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term.

**Why it's important:**     If you use Google Analytics, UTM tags give you more information about ad performance.

**What you need to know:**
- You can choose to keep your existing UTM tags, in which case, we only append the UTM tags that aren't included with your final URLs. Or you can choose to have Microsoft Advertising replace all of your existing tags with new UTM tags.
