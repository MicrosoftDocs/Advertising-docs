# Zip Code

**What it is:**     The zip code where an ad was physically served, or the zip code that your customer had shown interest in through searches or content they had viewed.

**Why itâ€™s important:**     This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
