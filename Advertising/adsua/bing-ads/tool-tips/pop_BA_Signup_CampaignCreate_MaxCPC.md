# Max. CPC

**What it is**: This is the maximum that you are willing to pay for a click on one of your ads.

**What you need to know**: The average cost per click (CPC) for Microsoft Advertising is around $0.84, though yours could be significantly higher or lower based on your business type and ROI goals.

**Tip**: Your budget is closely connected to an acceptable CPC. For example, you need to lower your CPC if it's depleting your budget too quickly. If you often have budget left over, you might have room for a higher CPC.
