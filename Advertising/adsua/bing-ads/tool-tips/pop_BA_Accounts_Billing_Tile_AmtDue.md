# Amount due

**What it is:**     Amount due is the amount you owe and have been billed for on this invoice account.

**What you need to know:**
- Credit adjustments, which are documented in "credit memos," might not be reflected in the amount due.
- Filtering the table does not affect the amount shown here.
