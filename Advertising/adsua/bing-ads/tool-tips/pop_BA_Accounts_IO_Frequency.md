# Frequency

**What it is:** The frequency defines how an order recurs within a series.

**What you need to know:** An insertion order can be set to recur monthly, every 2 months, quarterly, or yearly. Along with the frequency, you'll need to specify whether the series has an end date, has no end date, or ends after 1 - 60 occurrences.
