# Event goal

Event goals let you measure how visitors interact with your website. While other goals track information based on page changes,  event goals donâ€™t require a URL change to record data. For example, you can measure how many times a user pressed play on a video,  or the number of downloads made from your site.

To record an event goal, you must write a snippet of JavaScript to add to your website in addition to the Universal Event Tracking tag.   The code for events consists of four values. You must define **at least one** value:

**Category: **  The object you want to track (e.g., "button").

**Action: **  The type of interaction the user takes with the object (e.g. "click").

**Label: **  Your comments about the event (e.g. "purchase button").

**Value: **  A monetary value, or other numerical data, associated with the goal (e.g. "5", representing $5).

> [!NOTE]
> Commas are accepted in value fields, but decimals are not.
> No particular currency is associated with your goal value. You define a numerical representation.
