# Ad customizer default text

**What it is** : If you want your ad to appear **even if the circumstances defined by the feed's targeting and/or standard attributes are not met**, this word, phrase, or number will appear instead of the custom attribute value. Note: If a single ad customizer in an ad has default text defined, every other ad customizer in the same ad must also have default text defined.

**What you need to know** : Default text is optional.
