# Associate a Product Extension

**What you need to know:**  Google Ads does not include Product Extensions as part of the file Microsoft Advertising uses to import your campaigns.

Therefore, if you are importing Google Ads Product Listing Ads (as opposed to Google Ads Shopping campaigns), Microsoft Advertising will create a default "All Products" Product Extension for you.

The store ID you designate will be associated with this default Product Extension.
