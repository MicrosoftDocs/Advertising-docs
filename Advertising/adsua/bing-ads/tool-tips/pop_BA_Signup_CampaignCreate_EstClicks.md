# Estimated monthly clicks

**What it is:**     This is the number of times customers are expected to click your ads every month, given your keywords and your targeting and budget settings.

**What you need to know:**     Clicks are what you pay for. They typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).

**Tip:**     You pay for clicks on standard-quality clicks, not on low-quality or invalid clicks.
