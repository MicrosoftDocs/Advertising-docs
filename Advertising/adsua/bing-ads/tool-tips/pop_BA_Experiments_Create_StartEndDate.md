# Start and end dates

**What it is** : These define the time frame in which you want this experiment to run.

**What you need to know** : The soonest an experiment can start is the day after you create it, to give you time to make the changes you want to test. If you only want the experiment to run for a certain period of time, select an end date. Otherwise, select **None**.
