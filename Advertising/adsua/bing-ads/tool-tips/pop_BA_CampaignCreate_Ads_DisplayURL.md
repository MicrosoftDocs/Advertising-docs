# Display URL

**What it is:**     The webpage address that appears in your ad.

**What you need to know:**  The display URL is distinct from the destination URL. The destination URL is the actual webpage URL people are taken to after they click your ad. The display URL can be a shorter or "friendlier" version of your URL.

**Example:**  Let's say you sell wiper blades. While your destination URL might be http://www.contoso.com/content/en/parts/wipers (or likely much longer), your display URL could simply be contoso.com/wipers.

**Why itâ€™s important:**     It should give people a clear idea of where they will go when they click your ad.
