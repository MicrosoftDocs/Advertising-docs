# Retailer name

**What it is:**  The name of the retailer in Microsoft Merchant Center that contains offers for campaigns.

**What you need to know:**  Once you select a retailer for a campaign, you can't change it. If at some point you want to use a different retailer, you would need to create a new shopping campaign.
