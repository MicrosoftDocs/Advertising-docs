**What it is:**  Use this option to copy shipping settings from another store.

**What you need to know:**  You'll be shown a list of stores to copy settings from once you select the check box. If your selected store has shipping settings, you'll see the **Free shipping** and the **Add shipping labels** sections below update with that information. Then, you can customize the copied settings to fit the shipping requirements for this store.
