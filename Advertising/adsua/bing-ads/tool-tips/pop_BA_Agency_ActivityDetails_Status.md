# Status

As a request is created and then processed, it goes through several different statuses:

- **Action required** means that a request needs to be accepted, declined, or sent.
- **Pending** means that a sender has requested to change how an account is managed â€“ but that the client hasn't acted on the request yet.
- **Accepted, in progress** means that an advertiser accepted a request from a sender to manage their account. Once this is finalized in Microsoft Advertising, the status will become **Completed**.
- **Declined** means that an advertiser declined a request from a sender to manage their account.
- **Cancelled** means a sender cancelled a request to manage a recipient's account before the recipient could accept or decline the request.
- **In Progress** means that our system is currently processing a request.
- **Unsuccessful** means that there was a problem in our system, and we couldn't process a request from that sender.
- **Completed** means that we've taken care of the request and you're set to go!
