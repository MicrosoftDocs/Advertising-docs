# Estimated average position

**What it is:**        Estimated average position is the location that ads are likely to appear on the search results page. Although it varies, positions 1-4 appear at the top of the search results page and positions 5-10 appear in other locations (for example, the bottom or the sidebar).

**Why it's important:**        Ads that are on the first search results page tend to receive more clicks.

**Tip:**  After you've created this campaign, look at the **Avg. pos.** column on the **Keywords** table and make adjustments to keyword bids to move ads into the best position.
