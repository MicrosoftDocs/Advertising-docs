# Daily budget

**What it is:**  By default, this is the budget amount you set in the first step of the campaign-creation process.

**What you need to know:**  You can make any change to your budget you want to. There are two settings here:

- **Budget** : The amount of money you want to spend per day.
- **Daily budget options** : With the **Standard** option, your budget will be spent as evenly as appropriate throughout the day. With the **Accelerated** option, your budget will be spent as quickly as appropriate.

**Note** : Accelerated budgets are not recommended for most advertisers.
