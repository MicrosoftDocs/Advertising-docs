# Decrease budgets for multiple campaigns

**What it is:**        Decrease the budgets for selected campaigns by a fixed amount or a percentage.

**What you need to know:**        If you add a minimum budget amount, none of your budgets will go below that amount, except budgets that were already less than the minimum.

**Example:**        You have three selected campaigns with different daily budgets: $100, $300, and $500. You decrease the budget for these keywords by 50% and set the minimum budget to $80. Your first budget will be $80, because a 50% decrease is less than your minimum budget. Your second budget will be $150, and your third budget will be $250.
