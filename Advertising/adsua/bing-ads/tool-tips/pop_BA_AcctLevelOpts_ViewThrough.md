# View-through conversions

**What it is** : View-through conversions are conversions that people make after they have seen your ad, even though they did not click the ad.

**What you need to know** : By default, this is enabled, meaning that the values in the "All conv." columns of your campaigns or conversion goals tables will include view-through conversions. You can choose to disable it if you don't want to include view-through conversions in the All conv. column.
