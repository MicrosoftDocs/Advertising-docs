# Ad language

**What it is:** 	This is the language you will use to write your ads, so that you can target specific people.

**What you need to know:**
- You can choose one ad language per ad group.
- Once you select your ad language for an ad group, you can't change it.
- Ad language and location targets determine who can see your ads.

**Tip:** 	If you want to run your ads in multiple languages, consider setting up an ad group for each language.
