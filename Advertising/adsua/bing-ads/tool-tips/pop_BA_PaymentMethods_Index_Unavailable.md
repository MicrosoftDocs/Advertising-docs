# Unavailable payment method

When a payment method is marked "unavailable," there are four possible reasons:
- **Account type.**  Some payment methods, such as credit cards, can be used with both postpay and prepay accounts. Other payment methods, such as wire transfers, require a prepay account.
- **Country and currency.**  Some payment methods can only be used if your account is based in a specific country and uses a specific currency. For example, PayPal can only be used for accounts that have the currency set to Canadian dollar, euro, Mexican peso, Norwegian krone, UK pound, or US dollar.
- **Agency management.**  If your account is managed by an agency and they are responsible for paying the bill, then the payment method will be unavailable.
- **Inactive accounts.**  When accounts are deleted and become inactive, all payment methods become unavailable for that account.
