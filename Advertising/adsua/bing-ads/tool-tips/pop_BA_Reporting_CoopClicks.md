# Assisted clicks

**What it is:**     Clicks on your ads that have received co-bids from your manufacturer partners. Clicks are what you pay for.

**What you need to know:**  Clicks typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).
