# Average Position

**What it is:**        The average [position on the web page ](../hlp_BA_CONC_WhatIsAdPosition.md) for ads that were delivered during this period. Although it varies, positions 1-4 generally appear at the top of the search results page and positions 5-10 appear in other locations (for example, the bottom or the sidebar).

**Why it's important:**        Ads that are on the first search results page tend to receive more clicks.

**Tip:**  Refer to average position on the keywords table, and make adjustments to keyword bids to move ads into the best position.
