# Bid multiplier

**What it is:**  Adjust the bids of your hotels, hotel groups, or subaccounts based on various factors but will never cause your bid to exceed the subaccount maximum bid cap.

**What you need to know:**  The bid multiplier inherits all or nothing. For example, if you have a device type multiplier set at the hotel group level and a hotel within that group has a user country multiplier, then only the user country multiplier is used for that hotel.
