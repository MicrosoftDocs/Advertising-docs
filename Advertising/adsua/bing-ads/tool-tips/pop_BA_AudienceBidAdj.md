# Bid adjustment

**What it is:** The percentage you want to increase/decrease the bid amount for the audience.

**What you need to know:** You can increase the bid up to 900% and decrease by 90%.

**Tip:** If you are running the audience report, the bid adjustment column shows the current value even if a different bid adjustment value was used when the ad was shown.
