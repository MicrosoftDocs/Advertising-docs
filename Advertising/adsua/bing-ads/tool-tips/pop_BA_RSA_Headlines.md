# Headlines

**What it is:**  The headline is the most prominent part of your ad and serves as a link to your website.

**What you need to know:**  You can have up to 15 headlines but at most, three headlines will be chosen when your ad is served. Each headline can be up to 30 characters long and will appear separated by a vertical bar (|). You can select headlines to pin in the first, second, or third position.
