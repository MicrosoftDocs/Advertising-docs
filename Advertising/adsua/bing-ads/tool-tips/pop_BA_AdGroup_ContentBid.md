# Ad group content bid

**What it is: **    The maximum amount you are willing to pay each time your ad is clicked for bids in the content network. The content network is the ad distribution network for Bing ads running in Windows apps.

**What you need to know: **    The default bid is used for all your keywords in this ad group unless you set a custom bid for a keyword, which you can do at any time.

**Why it's important: **    You bid on keywords to get your ads to show up in Windows apps that have a limited number of places to show ads. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. If your bid isn't high enough, you might not get your desired placement.

**Example: **    If you sell shoes and bid on the keyword "shoe," youâ€™ll have to beat the bids of the other shoe sellers who are also bidding on "shoe." If your bid is not high enough, you might not get the space you want.
