# UET tag

**What it is:**     A Universal Event Tracking (UET) tag records what customers do on your website and sends that information to Microsoft Advertising.

**What you need to know:**     Select this if you want us to associate a specific UET tag with any remarketing list, audience, or conversion goal you’re importing. If you don’t have a UET tag in Microsoft Advertising yet, we will create one for you if you select this option.

**Note:**     The remarketing list, audience, or conversion goal you’re importing won’t function until the associated UET tag is included in your website’s code and modified as necessary for the specific list, audience, or goal.
