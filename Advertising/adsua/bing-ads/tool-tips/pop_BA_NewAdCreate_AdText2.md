# Ad text 2

**What it is:**        The second ad description that is shown below the path in your ad. To maximize impressions across all ad formats, the descriptions might not always be shown in your ad.

**Why it's important:**        You have more character space to work with in the ad text than in the ad title. So once the ad title has someoneâ€™s attention, the ad text needs to convince them to click it. What sets your product or service apart? How much does it cost? Include a call to action, a reason for customers to click **right now**.

**Note:** 	   Ad text cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
