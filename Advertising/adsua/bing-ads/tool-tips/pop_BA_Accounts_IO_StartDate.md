# Order start date

**What it is: ** The start date that you select is the date that your ads will be eligible to run on Microsoft Advertising if you have an approved order.

**What you need to know: ** You cannot edit the start date after the insertion order has become active.

**Tip: ** Your ads will stop running if you run out of budget, so you'll need to regularly monitor your account.
