# Increase in Clicks

The estimated increase in clicks can be a result of your ad showing up more frequently (increased impressions) or being in a better position on the search results page.

Donâ€™t be surprised if the estimated impressions and clicks increase at different rates for a specific bid suggestion. For example, if your ad is already on the first page and you use the suggested bid, you might find that impressions stay roughly the same but clicks increase as you move into a better position on the first page.
