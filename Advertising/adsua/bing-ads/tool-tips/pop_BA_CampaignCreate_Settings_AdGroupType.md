# Ad group type

**What it is:** Your shopping campaign can have one of two bid types for your ad groups: **Bid value** or **Bid boost**. Bid value is a flat amount that you pay each time someone clicks your ad. Bid boost automatically increases/decreases the bid amount by a percentage when your ad is clicked by a specific target audience. For example, you could increase bids for those who have abandoned a shopping cart and reduce bids for returning customers.
