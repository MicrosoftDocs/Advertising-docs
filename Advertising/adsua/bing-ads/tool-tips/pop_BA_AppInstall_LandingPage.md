# Landing page

**What it is:**  It is the actual webpage people are taken to when they click your ad, which is different than the simplified URL (display URL) that is the webpage address that appears in your ad.

**How it works:**  The landing page includes both the specific webpage URL and (optionally) tracking parameters, which allows you to find out how people got to your website.

**What you need to know:**  The final URL acts the same way as a destination URL with the following enhancements:
- Define a separate mobile URL if you have a website that is optimized for smaller devices.
- Separate the webpage URL from the tracking parameters so if you want to edit the parameters, you don't have to modify all your destination URLs. All you have to do is update the tracking template once and the changes apply across your account.
- Define custom parameters.
