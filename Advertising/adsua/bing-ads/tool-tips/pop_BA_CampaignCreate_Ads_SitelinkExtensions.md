# Sitelink Extensions

**What it is:**  Put additional links in your ads that take customers to specific pages on your website.

**What you need to know:**  You can also add up to two lines of descriptive text under each Sitelink Extension. These enhanced Sitelink Extensions can draw attention to your ad by increasing its size. Only high-quality ads at the top of the search results page will trigger enhanced Sitelink Extensions, so make sure you add descriptions to high-performing campaigns.

**Note:**  For each campaign, you can enter up to 20 Sitelink Extensions.
