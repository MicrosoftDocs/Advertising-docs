# Comparison range

You can compare performance between the selected time range and a comparison range:    previous period, same period last year, or moving average.    (Moving average takes an average over the last four periods. For example, if you are looking    at data for last Tuesday, the comparison graph shows you an average of the previous four Tuesdays.) The comparison range    answers the question "Is the performance trend data typical?"

> Moving average is only available for a time range up to 62 days.
