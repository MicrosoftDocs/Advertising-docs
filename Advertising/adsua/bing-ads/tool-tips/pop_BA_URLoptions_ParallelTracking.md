# Parallel tracking

**What it is** : This lets you send customers directly to your final URL while click measurement runs in the background.

**Why it's important** : Parallel tracking reduces the time it takes for your landing page to load, increasing customer satisfaction with your ad and website (making conversions more likely!).

**What you need to know** : You need to have {lpurl] or one of its variants in your URL's tracking template for parallel tracking to work. Parallel tracking must also be compatible with your tracking template provider. [Learn more about tracking and URL parameters](../hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_URLParameters.md)
