# Exact match impression share (%)

**What it is:**   The estimated percentage of impressions from searches that exactly matched your keyword, out of the total available exact match impressions it was eligible to receive.

**Why it’s important:**     Exact match impression share data highlights how your keywords perform only on those searches that exactly match your keywords. Use this data, together with impression share, to diagnose your non-exact match keywords and make changes to be more competitive and gain more impressions.
