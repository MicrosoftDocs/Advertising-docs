# Campaign budget

**What it is** : This is the amount of money you want to spend per day.

**What you need to know** : Under **Daily budget options**, you will see two options:

- **Standard** : With this option, your budget will be spent as evenly as appropriate throughout the day.
- **Accelerated** : With this option, your budget will be spent as quickly as appropriate.

**Note** : Accelerated budgets are not recommended for most advertisers.
