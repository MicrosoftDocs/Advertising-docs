# NZ GST registration number

**What it is:**  The New Zealand GST registration number is an 8- or 9-digit number issued by New Zealand's Inland Revenue Department.

**Why is it important:**  If you do not provide your NZ GST registration number, we will apply the New Zealand Goods and Services Tax (NZ GST) at the standard rate. The registration number will also appear on your billing documents thereafter.
