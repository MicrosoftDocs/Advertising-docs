# Clicks

**What it is:**  Clicks are one of the metrics used to measure the performance of your advertising.

**What you need to know:**  Clicks typically include a customer clicking on your hotel ad on the search results page or map results. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).

**Tip:**  You pay for clicks on standard-quality clicks, not on low-quality or invalid clicks.
