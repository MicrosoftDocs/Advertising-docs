# Keyword insertion default text

**What it is**: This is the word or phrase you want to appear in this place in your ad if:
- We can't find a keyword to insert, or
- The keyword that would be inserted violates Microsoft Advertising policies or makes the text string too long.

**What you need to know**: Default text is not required, but is highly recommended. Your ad's wording may be garbled if it appears without a keyword, and your ad won't run if the keyword that would be inserted violates Microsoft Advertising policies or makes the text string too long.
