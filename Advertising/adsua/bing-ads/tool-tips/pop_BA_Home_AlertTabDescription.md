# Alerts

Microsoft Advertising sends you alerts to let you know about important events relating to your account. Critical alerts are issues that can prevent you from using Microsoft Advertising and are marked with an exclamation point. You can modify which alerts you see by clicking the gear icon ![gear icon](../../images/BA_Icons_Gear.png), and then click **Settings** (or from global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** and then click **Settings**). After you fix an issue, the alert doesnâ€™t go away automatically. You have to select the alert and click **Delete.**

Alerts provide information about four aspects of your account:

- **Account**: Account status changes and other account events.
- **Billing**: Budget changes, credit card status, declined charges, and other billing events.
- **Campaign**: Campaign changes, editorial rejections, and other campaign-related events.
- **General**: Service alerts, server maintenance updates, and other events.
