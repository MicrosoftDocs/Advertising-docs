# Start date

**What it is: ** The start date is the date that you want to start managing the account. You can select **immediately**, or you can pick a specific date.

**What you need to know: **

- The account owner has 30 days to approve this request. If approved, you will see the account in your accounts list, but there can be a short delay (up to 2 hours) before you can edit the account.
- Dates are based on the account's time zone.
