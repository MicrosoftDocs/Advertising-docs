# Hour

**What it is:**    The hour column shows a number that tells you which hour of the day your data is from along with the Date column that shows you what day.    The numbers start with 0, which is 12:00 AM, and goes up to 23, which is 11:00 PM, in the account time zone.

**Why itâ€™s important:**    You can use this information to identify if there is a specific hour where you get more traffic and then you can use bid adjustments to target that time.
