# Skipped items

Items that were skipped during import had errors that didn't get resolved before importing or were marked to be deleted. If you have skipped items with errors, you will see a link below to download your import errors to a spreadsheet. You can download the errors, fix them, and then upload the spreadsheet (using **Import from file**).
