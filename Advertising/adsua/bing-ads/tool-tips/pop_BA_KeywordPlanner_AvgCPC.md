# Average Cost per click (CPC)

**What it is: **The average amount you might pay for a click. For example, if you pay a total of $48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is $0.16.

**What you should know: **Average CPC is not the same as current bid (max CPC). Current bid is the maximum cost-per-click that you are willing to pay (not including your bid adjustments).
