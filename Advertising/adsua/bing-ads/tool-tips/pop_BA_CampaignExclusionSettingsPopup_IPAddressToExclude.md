# IP address exclusions

You can specify Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that you would like to exclude from seeing your ads.        This list will apply only to ads in this campaign. You can enter fully specified IP addresses or use the wildcard character (\*) for the last 3 digits to specify blocks of addresses. For example, you can type:

- 123.4.5.67
- 123.4.5.\*
- 123.45.167.1

For more info, see [How to prevent your ads from showing on specific websites or to certain people](../hlp_BA_PROC_AddExclusions.md).
