# Scope

**What it is:**  This setting determines if the conversion goal applies to all accounts or a specific account. If you have multiple Microsoft Advertising accounts, you can track conversions across all of those accounts. If you associate a goal with one account, conversions will be tracked for that account only.

**What you need to know:**  The currency of the revenue value will be determined based on the account currency to which the conversion was attributed.
