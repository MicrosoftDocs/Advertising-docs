# Return on ad spend (ROAS)

**What it is:**   Revenue divided by spend, expressed as a percentage. For example, if your revenue is $30,000 and your advertising spend is $20,000, ROAS = 150% (30,000/20,000 x 100).

**Why it’s important:**   You’ll need to use universal event tracking for the ROAS to show data.
