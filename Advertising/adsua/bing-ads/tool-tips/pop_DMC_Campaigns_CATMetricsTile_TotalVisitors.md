# Total website visitors from your ads

**What it is:** The total number of visitors to your website after clicking your ads in this campaign, during the selected date range.

**What you need to know:**
- Data collection begins after you add your tracking tag to your website’s code.
- A zero displays if there's no data available for the selected date range—either because the selected date range is before you set up customer action tracking or because you received no traffic from your ad in this date range.
