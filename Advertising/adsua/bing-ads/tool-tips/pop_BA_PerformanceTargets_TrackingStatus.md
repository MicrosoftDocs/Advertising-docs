# Performance target status

**What it is:**    An estimate of whether your campaigns are on track to successfully meet your performance target.

**Possible statuses:**
- **         On track:       **     Based on recent performance, your campaigns are on track to meet your target.
- **         Needs attention:       **     Based on recent performance, one or more of your performance target metrics are not on track to be met.
- **       Not available:     **  Your performance target cannot be determined at this time. Check back soon.
- **       Met:     **   The performance target’s date range has passed, and your campaigns met its target.
- **         Not met:       **     The performance target’s date range has passed, and your campaigns did not meet its target.
