# Website

**What it is** : This is your website's domain, the root part of your URL.

**What you need to know** : Website domains usually end with a period and a 2- or 3-letter suffix, as in ".com" or ".net".

**Note** : Do not include additional paths or directories after your domain. For example, “contoso.com” is valid, but “contoso.com/”, “contoso.com?”, “test.contoso.com”, and “contoso.com/gadgets” are not.
