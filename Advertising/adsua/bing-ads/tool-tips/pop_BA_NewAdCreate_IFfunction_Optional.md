# Otherwise

**What it is** : This is the text that will appear in your title, path, or ad text field if the IF function isn't met.

**What you need to know** : To keep you ad running, we recommend that you have default text in case the ad doesn't meet the IF function. For example, if the customer isn’t on a mobile device or included in the selected audience.

**Note** : If a single IF function in an ad has default text defined, every other IF function in the same ad must also have default text defined.
