# Otherwise

**What it is**: This is the text that will appear in your title, path, or ad text field if the IF function isn't met.

**What you need to know**: To keep you ad running, we recommend that you have default text in case the ad doesn't meet the IF function. For example, if the customer isnâ€™t on a mobile device or included in the selected audience.

**Note**: If a single IF function in an ad has default text defined, every other IF function in the same ad must also have default text defined.
