# Countdown start

**What it is**: This is when you want this ad to start running. When it is exactly this many days before your countdown end date and time, the ad will start running.

**What you need to know**: When your ad appears on a search results page, the countdown tag will be replaced by text such as "3 days," "13 hours," or "37 minutes," depending on this setting and your end date and time.

**Tip**:  This field is optional. If you leave it blank, the countdown will start five days before your end date and time.
