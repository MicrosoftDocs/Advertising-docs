# Estimated first page bid

**What it is:**      Based on your campaign performance and marketplace dynamics, this estimate is the bid amount that Microsoft Advertising calculates for your ad to be placed on the first page sidebar in the search results.

**What you need to know:**      These estimates are provided as a reference only. They are automatically generated by Microsoft Advertising and are not a guarantee of ad position.

**No estimates available:**      If you are not seeing estimates in the table, there might not be enough data to generate them. Check back later.
