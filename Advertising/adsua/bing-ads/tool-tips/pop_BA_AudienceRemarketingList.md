# Remarketing list

**What it is:**  A list you define of people who have visited or interacted with your website before.

**What you need to know:**  You associate a remarketing list with an ad group to target or exclude your ad from showing to people in the list. For example, it is a great way to bring previous visitors back to your website and drive sales.

**Tip:**  To create a remarketing list, in the left pane, click **Shared Library** and then **Audiences** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** and then **Audiences**).
