# Document type

These are the document types that can appear on the Billing tab. (Not all of them will apply to all accounts.)

**Invoice. **For monthly invoiced accounts, this document covers 1 month of advertising. Invoices are typically posted on the Billing tab by the 2nd  business day of each month for the previous month's charges.

**Statement. **For postpay threshold and prepay accounts, statements show itemized charges per campaign and payments.

**Payment receipt. **For all account types, a payment receipt documents the payment of funds in advance (prepay accounts) or the payment of funds after charges have accrued (postpay accounts).

**Credit memo. **In situations where we need to credit your account (for example, invalid clicks), you will see a line item for a credit memo.

**Debit memo. **In situations where we need to charge your account outside of the normal billing process, you will see a line item for a debit memo.

**Pending. **For postpay threshold accounts, a pending document shows the advertising costs you've accrued before your cutoff (which takes place when you reach your billing threshold amount or the monthly billing date, whichever comes first). A pending document excludes tax charges. The pending status changes to "Statement" once you meet the cutoff. Your statement contains the final amount, including any applicable taxes.
