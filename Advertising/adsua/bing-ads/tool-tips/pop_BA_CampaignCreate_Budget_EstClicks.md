# Estimated clicks

**What it is:**     This is the number of times customers are expected to click your ads every month, given the bid you set.

**What you need to know:**     Clicks are one of the metrics used to measure the performance of your advertising.   They typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).

**Tip:**     You pay for clicks on standard-quality clicks, not on low-quality or invalid clicks.
