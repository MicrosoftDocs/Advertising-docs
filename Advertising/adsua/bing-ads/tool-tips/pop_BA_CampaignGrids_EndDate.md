# End date

**What it is:**        You can schedule ads in a particular ad group to end on a specific date. For example, you might want to stop running ads to align with a specific event, such as the end of a sale.

**What you need to know:**        By default, there is no end date. If you want to make changes to the end date, go to ad group settings.
