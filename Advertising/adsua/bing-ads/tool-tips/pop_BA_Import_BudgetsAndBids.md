# Bids and budgets

**      What it is:**     Due to differences in Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads minimum bid and budget requirements, any bids and budgets below the Microsoft Advertising minimum amount will automatically be raised during import.

**      Why it's important:**     This means that the amount of money you spend overall may increase for the imported campaigns.

**      What you need to know:**     If you decide to opt out of increasing the minimum bid and budget during import, any campaigns that donâ€™t meet the minimum amount will not get imported.
