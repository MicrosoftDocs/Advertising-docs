# Everything else

**What it is** : The performance metrics for all entities **not** associated with the labels in the table.

**What you need to know** : If you don’t have any filters applied, the **Everything else** row represents all entities without labels. If you’re filtering on, say, 3 labels out of a total of 10, this row represents all entities without these 3 labels.

**Tip** : This can be a handy way to compare groups of labels without having to create overarching labels for them.
