# Estimated monthly average CPM

**What it is** : This is the estimated monthly spend divided by the estimated number of impressions (in thousands) expected for this campaign, given your current settings.

**What you need to know** : An impression is counted when 50% or more of your ad is viewable for one second or longer. Videos must play continuously for two seconds or longer to be counted.  Impressions are also counted when a user clicks on the ad. You pay for impressions by the thousand.

**Note** : This estimate is provided as a reference only. It is automatically generated by Microsoft Advertising and is not a guarantee of future performance.
