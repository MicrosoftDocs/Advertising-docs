# Campaign budget

**Why it's important**: This is the amount of money you want to spend per day. You have two budget options:

- **Individual budget**: This budget will be used by this campaign only.
- **Apply a budget from the Shared Library**: Select one of the shared budgets you set up in the Shared Library. This campaign will draw from the same budget as the other campaigns using this shared budget. [Learn more about shared budgets](../hlp_BA_CONC_SharedBudgets.md)

**What you need to know**: Your budget will be spent as evenly as appropriate throughout the day. Microsoft Advertising will help you spend for optimized performance based on the products or services targeted by your campaign and availability of corresponding user searches during the day.

The daily budget you set is a targetâ€”your actual spend might be higher or lower. Variations are caused by a number of factors, such as different traffic volumes in different days of the week, or automatic detection and refunding of fraud clicks that can give money back to a campaign within a few hours of the click. Microsoft Advertising anticipates and automatically compensates for the fluctuations, and usually keeps overspend to less than 100% above your daily limit.
