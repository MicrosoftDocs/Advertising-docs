# CPA

**What it is: **  Cost per acquisition (CPA) is total spend divided by conversions that are attributable to your ad.

**Why itâ€™s important: **  CPA tells you how much each conversion is costing you. It's one indicator to suggest whether your overall campaign is cost-effective or profitable.
