# Call Extensions

**What it is:**  Put your business's phone number in your ads, which customers can click to dial.

**What you need to know:**  With Call Extensions, you have two options: You can use your own phone number or use a Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number. When using a forwarding number, we assign a unique phone number that displays in your ad. When a customer calls this number, the call is routed to your business phone number. Our forwarding number allows you to track all calls from this ad, no matter where the call was made from, so that you can analyze the ad performance.

**Tip:**  Call Extensions can be used together with Location Extensions. When these two features are used at the same time, the phone numbers displayed and the availability of click-to-call depend on the device where the ad is being viewed. To understand what to expect when using these features together, see [How Call and Location Extensions work together](../hlp_BA_CONC_CallNLocExtensions.md)
