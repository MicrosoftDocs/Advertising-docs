# Estimated monthly impressions

**What it is:**      This is the number of times customers are expected to see your ads every month, given your keywords and your targeting and budget settings.

**Why it's important:**        Regardless of whether you are driving customers to your website, tracking conversions, or just trying to get your message out, youâ€™ll want to track the number of times your ad is shown.
