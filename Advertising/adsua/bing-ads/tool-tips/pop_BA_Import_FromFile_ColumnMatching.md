# Column matching

These column headings indicate what kind of data you're importing -- ad titles, keywords, or campaign budgets, for example. We'll look at your spreadsheet and make our best guess as to what type of data is in each column. However, to import your data accurately, you should check to make sure we got it right.

It's okay if some columns are not matched -- this data just won't get imported.  For example, if you import a spreadsheet that you exported from Google Ads, there are certain types of data we can't import, such as CTR or Impressions, so these would be marked here as "Not matched."
