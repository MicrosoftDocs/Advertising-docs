# Which option should I choose...

**Use an existing email address**  if:
- You already have a Microsoft account that you use to sign in to services such as Office365, Skype, or Outlook.com.
- You use two different user names to sign in to two separate Microsoft Advertising accounts, and you'd like to [combine access into one email address](../hlp_BA_CONC_UserNamePermissions.md). (See notes below.)
- You want to sign in using an existing work, school, or personal email address from a service such as Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo. (See notes below.)

**Create a new email address**  if you do not want to use or do not have an existing personal email address.

**Notes**
- You can merge two user names by entering the personal email address or the Microsoft account you want to use to sign in. However, if you have more than two Microsoft Advertising user names, you will need to contact your account manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to add multi-user access to your user name.
- Don't share user names. Having separate user accounts is [more secure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=528347) and also has the benefit of letting you use [change history](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=529956) to review changes made per user.
