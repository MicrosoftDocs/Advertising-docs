# Set backup payment method

To keep your campaign running without interruption, you can set one of your payment methods as a backup.     That way, if we run into problems charging your primary payment method (for example, a credit card expires or exceeds its limit),     we will use your backup payment method to pay for your Microsoft Advertising charges.
