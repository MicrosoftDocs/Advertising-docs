# Delivered match type

This column will show you the match type that was used to deliver your ad. Delivered match type can be different than the bid match type you chose for your keyword.

For example, you might have bid on a broad match for the keyword “house.” If someone searches on “ranch house” and your ad is shown, we record that as a broad match. However, if someone searches on “house” and your ad is shown, we record that as an exact match.

Comparing bid match type and delivered match type in your keyword performance report can help you fine tune your campaign.
