# Enable API management

**What it is:**  Starts the process of enabling your catalog and store for the Content API.

**Why it's important:**  The Content API allows you to automate the product feeds for your catalogs instead of manually uploading those feeds using FTP. Learn more about the [Content API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=404097).

**What you need to know:**  If you enable API management, you will not be able to upload your catalog feed using an automatic download, a manual upload, or FTP.
