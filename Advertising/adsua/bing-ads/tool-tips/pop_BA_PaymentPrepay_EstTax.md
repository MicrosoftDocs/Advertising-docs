# Estimate taxes

You must pay the taxes required by the country in which you are doing business. When you click **Estimate Taxes**, we will show you an estimate of how much of the prepaid amount will be spent on taxes and how much will apply to your ad campaign.

**Note:** This is only an estimate of the tax owed on this payment. Recent changes in tax rates may not be reflected in this estimate. You are responsible for the payment of any required taxes that appear on the billing statement you receive, which may be different from the estimate. The actual tax will be itemized in the billing statement you receive after making a payment.
