# Performance and distribution graphs

**What it is:**         Use these two sets of graphs to visualize how your account is performing. With the performance trend graphs, you can review metrics such as clicks, impressions, and spend. Additionally, you can compare this data for a custom time range against a comparison range: previous period, same period last year, or moving average. This lets you determine if your results are typical when compared to past periods.

The keyword distribution graph is a set of charts that display detailed performance data for your keywords at a glance. The charts help you quickly see which of your keywords are generating lots of impressions, clicks, or conversions. You can also identify which of your keywords aren’t performing well.

**When to use:**         Use the performance graphs to get time-based trend data for a variety of metrics, and more importantly compare that trend to previous data. Quickly identify which metrics are moving in the wrong direction and take action to correct.

Use the keyword distribution graph to compare all of your keywords against each other. Identify your best and worst performers and take the appropriate action. Maybe you need to increase or reduce bids for certain keywords, or even remove some if they are performing poorly.
