# Suggested ad

**What it is:** An ad created for you by Microsoft Advertising, based on content from your existing ads, such as keywords, ad extensions, landing page, and targeting.

**Why it's important:** Ad groups with three or more quality ads tend to perform better than those with one or none. Suggested ads are created for ad groups that show potential for better performance.
