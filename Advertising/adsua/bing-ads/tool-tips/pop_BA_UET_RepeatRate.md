# Repeat rate

**What it is:**   This is the ratio of **all conversions** / **unique conversions** during your chosen conversion window for the selected date range.

**Why it matters:**     Repeat rate can give you insight into how often a click converts, whether you choose to count "All" or "Unique" conversions.

**Keep in mind:**     This number applies to a particular conversion action (ex. newsletter signups), not all conversion actions.

**Example:**     Your customers make an average of 2.5 purchases over a 30-day period after clicking on your ad. The repeat rate for your "purchase" conversion action will show a value of 2.5.
