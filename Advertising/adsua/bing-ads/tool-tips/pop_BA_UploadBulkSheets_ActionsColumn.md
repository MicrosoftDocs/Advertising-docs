# Actions column

**What it is** : For each upload you have performed, you can download a spreadsheet to review the updates or fix any errors. If your upload encountered no errors, you will see a **Download results** button in this column. If your upload encountered at least one error, you will see a **Download** drop-down. Click this, then choose to **Download all results** or **Download errors only**.

**Note** : Only use **Download errors only** for reference. To fix errors, you should use **Download all results**.
