# Account status

**Active:** Your account has a valid payment method, and your ads are eligible to run.

**Pending:** You need to [add a credit card or other valid payment method](../hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md).

**Inactive:** You have deleted the account. There are no ad groups running and no new charges accruing in the account.

**Paused:** If you have a prepay account and run out of money, we will pause your account. If you have a postpay or monthly invoice account and your account is paused, you should contact Support.

**Blocked:** If you unlink from an agency, your account might be temporarily blocked until any outstanding charges are settled.
