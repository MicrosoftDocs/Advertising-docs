# Demographic

**What it is: **       The gender and age of the people who you have targeted to see your ad.

**What you need to know: **       Unlike other types of targeting, demographic targeting is not exclusionary (everyone can see your ad). However, by using bid adjustments you can make it more likely that people of a certain age and gender will see your ad.
