# Position above rate

**What it is:**  The percentage of time competitors’ ads showed up higher than your ads on the search results page,    when both of your ads were shown at the same time. For example, if a competitor listed in your Auction insights report is showing 5%     in the Position above rate column, it means that the competitor’s ad showed in a position above yours in 5 out of every 100 times your     ads showed at the same time.

**Why it’s important:**  If the rate is high, the other advertiser is getting more desirable ad positions than you. A high rate is likely due to a poor quality score or a low bid.

**Tip:**  Look at avg. position on the **Keywords** table, and make adjustments to keyword bids to move ads into the best position.
