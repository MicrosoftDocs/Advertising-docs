# Target location

**What it is** : This makes the other attributes in this feed item only apply for ads showing to people in a certain geographic location (country, city, postal code, etc.) and/or people searching for or viewing pages about this location.

**What you need to know** : If you want to target only people **physically in** a location, you will need to use the **Target location restriction** attribute as well.
