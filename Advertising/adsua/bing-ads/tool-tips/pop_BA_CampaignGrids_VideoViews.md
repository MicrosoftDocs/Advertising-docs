# Video views

**What it is** : Video views include the number of times your video was played for a user for two continuous seconds or with more than 50% of the screen in view.

**What you need to know** : If you select CPV as the bidding strategy, you pay for a video view or a click, whichever happens first. Video views do not include click interactions with the ad, which are captured in the Clicks metric.
