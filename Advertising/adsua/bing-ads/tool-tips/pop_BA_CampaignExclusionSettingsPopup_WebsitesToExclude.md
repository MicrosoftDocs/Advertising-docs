# Website exclusions

If you want to prevent your ads from appearing on certain websites, just enter the website URL in the box. This list will apply only to ads in this campaign. For example, you can type:

- contoso.com
- www.contoso.com
- autos.contoso.com
- contoso.com/widgets
- http://www.contoso.com
- https://www.contoso.com

If you want to block all traffic from a specific domain, leave off the "www" prefix. For example, use "contoso.com" if you want to block traffic from www.contoso.com and www2.contoso.com.

You canâ€™t add Yahoo or Microsoft sites (such as microsoft.com) to your excluded websites list.
