# Increase current bids

**What it is:**        Increase the current bids for selected keywords by a percentage or fixed amount.

**What you need to know:**        If you add a maximum bid amount, none of your bids will exceed that amount, except bids that were already more than the maximum.

**Example:**        You have three keywords with different bids: $1, $5, and $10. You increase the current bid for these keywords by 50% and set the maximum bid to $7. Your first bid is now $1.50, your second bid is $7 (the maximum), and your third bid stays the same ($10), because it was already higher than the maximum bid.
