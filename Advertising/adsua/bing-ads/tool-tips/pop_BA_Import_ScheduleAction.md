# Action

**What it is:**  You can edit the import settings or schedule by choosing **Edit** in this column. Choosing **Run now** will run an import immediately. You can review the results after the import completes.

**What you need to know:**  By choosing **Edit** you will be taken back to the import options workflow where you can make changes. On the **Import schedule **&amp;** history** page, a new schedule will be created, and the one you modified will be set to **Deleted**. Running a new import may take a few minutes and require you to refresh the grid to see your updated results.
