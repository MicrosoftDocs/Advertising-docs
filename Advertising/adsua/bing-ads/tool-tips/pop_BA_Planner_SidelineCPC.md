# Sidebar CPC

**What it is:**  The total cost of all clicks on an ad that is on the side of the page divided by the number of clicks. In Campaign Planner, this is calculated based on the vertical, product, and keywords selected.

**Why important:**  This is the average amount that is charged when an ad at the side of the page is clicked. For example, if the total is $48.35 for 300 clicks, the average CPC is $0.16.
