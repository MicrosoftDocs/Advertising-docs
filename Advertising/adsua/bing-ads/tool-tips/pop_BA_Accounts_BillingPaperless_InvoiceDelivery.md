# Invoice delivery

**What it is:**     For most accounts payable contacts, monthly invoices can be delivered in one of two ways:
- Email only
- Email and postal mail

**What you need to know:**
- If your billing address is in one of the following countries/regions, you must also receive invoices via postal mail as mandated by local regulations: China, Colombia, India, Korea, Panama, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, and Venezuela.
- Invoices are sent out by the 2nd business day of each month for charges that accrued during the previous month. They're also available in the Billing tab by the 2nd business day of the month.
