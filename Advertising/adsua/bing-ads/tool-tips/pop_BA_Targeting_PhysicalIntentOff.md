# Show ads to people in, searching for, or viewing pages about your targeted location

**What it is:**      By selecting this option, your ads will show to people who are physically in your targeted location as well as people outside of your area who search for or view webpages about your targeted location.

**Example:**      Your ad is for a hotel in Paris and you want to advertise to people in Paris as well as those outside of the city who might be planning a visit.
