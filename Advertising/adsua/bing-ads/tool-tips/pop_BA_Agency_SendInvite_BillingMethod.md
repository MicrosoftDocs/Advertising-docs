# Who pays

**What it is:**  You can choose whether the client pays the account charges or you (the agency) pay the account charges. Whoever pays is known as **the bill-to customer**.

**What you need to know:**

If you choose to pay the account charges:

- You assume responsibility for all of the account's advertising charges, including any charges that are in progress when the client approves your linking request.
- It can take up to 2 hours for us to process this request after the client approves it. During this time, no one will be able to make changes to the account.
- If you are trying to fund a prepay account and your client is in a country with tax requirements, we might be required to deduct tax from the prepay amount. Here are [tax requirements for each country](../hlp_BA_CONC_TaxVATInfo.md).
