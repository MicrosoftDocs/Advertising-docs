# Expanded targeting

**What it is** : Enabling expanded targeting allows Microsoft Advertising to show your ads to additional customers similar to the ones you currently target.

**Why it's important** : This is an easy way to expand your ad campaign's reachâ€”let us find qualified customers for you, without requiring you to take the effort to identify and target them.

**For example** :  If you target a specific LinkedIn audience segment, we will also target Bing users who don't have a confirmed LinkedIn account but who share the same characteristics as LinkedIn users in that segment.
