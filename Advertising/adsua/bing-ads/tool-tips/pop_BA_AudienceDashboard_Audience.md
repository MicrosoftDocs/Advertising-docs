# Audience

**What it is** : With audience targeting, you specify who can see your ads using remarketing lists, custom audiences, or in-market audiences. You can also exclude audiences if you don’t want them to see your ads.

**What you need to know** : Not everyone has custom audiences and in-market audiences yet. If you don’t, don’t worry — they're coming soon!

- [In-market audiences: Reach people who are ready to buy](../hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_InMarketAudience.md)

**Note** : As you add and edit targets, pay attention to the audience meter on the right side of the page. If your targeting becomes too narrow, you won't be able to save your campaign.
