**Payments declined:**  Your account is on hold because your financial institution declined a payment (credit card, debit card, or PayPal). If this is an issue with your billing information (address, phone, expiration date) or if you want to use a different payment method, click **Fix declined payments**. If you want to continue using the payment method that is on hold, you will need to first check with your financial institution to see why the payment was declined (for example, a charge exceeded your authorized limit).

**Payments not received:**  Your account is on hold because we have not received payment. This applies to monthly invoiced customer or whoever pays for the account (the bill-to customer). On the Billing tab, verify that your outstanding balance has been paid, and then [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371).

**Payment in progress:**  You have resolved the issue with your declined payments and have paid your account balance, which is in process. This can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
