# Manager account number

**What it is:**  The manager account number is a ten-digit mix of numbers (0-9) and letters (a-z, A-Z).

**What you need to know:** If you're working with a client, you'll need to obtain your client's manager account number. Otherwise, you can find a manager account number by clicking **Accounts** from the global menu. Then, the manager account number is listed in the **Management** table in **Accounts summary**.
