# Budget type

**What it is:**        The setting for how your budget is spent: daily-standard or shared-standard. 	   You can change your budget amount and budget types at any time.

**Why it's important:**       When thinking about changes to your budget, you need to consider your budget type. This campaign setting determines how your budget is distributed throughout the day and affects how quickly your budget is spent.
