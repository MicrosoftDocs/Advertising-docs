# Second level category

**What it is:**    Microsoft Advertising analyzes your website and categorizes its content. The second level category is the narrowest level—for example, if the top level category is "shoes", the first level category might be "women's" and second level categories might be "casual" or "business".

**Why it’s important:**  Find out what gets customers to the parts of your website you want them to visit.
