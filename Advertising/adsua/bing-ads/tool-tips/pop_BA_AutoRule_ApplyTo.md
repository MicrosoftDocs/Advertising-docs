# Apply to

**What it is:**  The entities you want the action to apply to. Generally your choices are **All** (All campaigns, All keywords, etc.) or **Enabled** (Enabled campaigns, Enabled keywords, etc.). The difference is that **All** will include entities that are paused or in some other way not enabled.
