# App URL or Measurement URL

**What it is:**  If you want to enable reporting app installs as conversions, you will need to enter the **measurement URL**  provided by one of Microsoft Advertising certified partners (Kochava, Tune, Appsflyer, Singular, Adjust, and Branch).

**What you need to know:**  If you do not want to report app installs, enter the **app URL**  from the Windows Store, the Windows Phone Store, the Apple App Store, or Google Play, where users can directly access the app store to download the app.
