# Excluded stores

**What it is:**  This gives you the ability to exclude one or more stores from an all-retailers campaign when "All linked stores" is selected in the store control.

**What you need to know:**  The store control determines which retailers you want to partner with in this campaign and allows you to select only one specific retailer or all retailers.
