# Status

**What it is** :

The status of your bid strategy, which can be:

- **Active** : The bid strategy is active and optimized for your goals.
- **Learning** : If youâ€™ve recently added one or more campaigns to this strategy, we need a few weeks to gather performance data and learn how to make the most effective bids.
- **Limited** : At least one of your campaigns is constrained by a low budget.
- **Inactive** : The portfolio bid strategy has no active campaigns.
- **Misconfigured** : At least one campaign using this bid strategy has a shared budget that could be limiting the performance.
