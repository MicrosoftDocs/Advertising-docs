# Language

**What it is:** 	This is the language you will use to write your ads, so that you can target specific people.

**What you need to know:**
- Ad language determines where your ads are eligible to appear. For example, if you select German, then your ads can appear on webpages in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but not in Spain.
- You can also narrow the locations where your ad will appear using location targeting.
- Once you select and save your ad language, you won't be able to change it.
- Be sure to write your ads in the language that you target, since Microsoft Advertising doesn't translate ads or keywords. If you want to show ads in multiple languages, we recommend creating a separate campaign for each language.
