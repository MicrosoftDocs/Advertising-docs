# Impression share

**What it is:**  The number of times your ad is shown as a percentage of the total available impressions in the market you were targeting.

**Why itâ€™s important:**  Reports on impression share highlight information about how many impressions you're missing and why. Use this data to inform you about making changes to get more impressions, increasing the likelihood of more clicks on those ads, and thus, the likelihood of more sales.
