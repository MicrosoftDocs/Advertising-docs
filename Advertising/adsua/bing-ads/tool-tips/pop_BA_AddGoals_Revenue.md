# Revenue to track

You can track how much money you make for each conversion.

- If you earn the same amount for each conversion, such as a website registration fee, select **Constant**. In the **Value** box, enter the amount you collect per conversion.
- If you earn a variable amount for each conversion, such as a sales total, select **Variable**.

The revenue totals based on these options will appear in your conversion tracking performance reports. If you do not want to track how much money you make for each conversion, select **None**.
