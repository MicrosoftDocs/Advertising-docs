# Absolute top impression share (%)

**What it is:**     The estimated percentage of times your ad was in the first position of all results, out of the estimated number of first position impressions you were eligible to receive.

**Why it’s important:**     A low number means your ads rarely appear in the topmost position of most search traffic, which is more likely to win click and conversion. To improve absolute top impression share, increase your bid or budget.
