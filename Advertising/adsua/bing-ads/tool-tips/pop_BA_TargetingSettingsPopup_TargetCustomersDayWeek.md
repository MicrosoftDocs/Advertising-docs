# Target certain days

Your ads are eligible to display every day of the week, but in some cases, you might want to limit advertising to those days that you know your        target customer is searching for your product (for example, Saturday and Sunday).

You can also make a bid adjustment: a percentage increase to your        keyword bid to improve the chance that your ad will display to people searching during a specific day of the week.        For example, if your target customer is shopping for your products during the work week, you could increase your bid by         30% for Monday through Friday.

For more information, see [Using targeting to display your ads to the right people](../hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md)        and [Target customers with bid adjustments](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md).

> If you are creating a new campaign or ad group, you cannot apply a bid adjustment.        Bid adjustments are made on the ad group or campaign Settings page.
