# Keywords

**What it is** : Keywords are the words or phrases you associate with your ads so potential customers searching the web can find your ads. Think about how a customer would search for products or services you offer when you choose your keywords.

**What you need to know** : In the **Enter keywords** box, you can type or paste keywords separated by commas or one keyword at a time. You can set the keyword match type by including brackets or quotes:
- Keyword = Broad match keyword
- "Keyword" = Phrase match keyword
- [Keyword] = Exact match keyword

**Tip** : For the best chance of success, we recommend having at least 20 keywords in each ad group and at least 50 keywords across your campaign. If you're having a hard time thinking of enough keywords, try using **Get keyword suggestions**.

**Note:** 	   A keyword cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
