# Backup payment method

Your backup payment method is used to pay for your Microsoft Advertising charges when there is a problem charging your primary payment method. Just like the primary payment method, your account type (prepay or postpay) and the country and currency for the account determine which backup payment methods are valid for your account.For more information, see [How to pay for Microsoft Advertising](../hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).
