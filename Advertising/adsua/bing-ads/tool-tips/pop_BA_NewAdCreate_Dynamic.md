# Ad title

The ad title is the clickable and most prominent part of your ad, so make sure to optimize the 25 characters of space Microsoft Advertising provides for your ad title.		The most obvious way to call a searcher's attention to your ad is to include keywords in your ad title. You can do this manually or by using dynamic text.

**Using dynamic text in ad titles:**  		Dynamic text is a word, phrase, or other information that is inserted into the ad title or text. 		Use the {KeyWord} variable to insert keywords in your ads that match, or closely match, the text that a customer typed. 		By using {KeyWord} in your ad title and text, Microsoft Advertising automatically inserts your keyword into the ad when that ad is displayed.
