# Upload type

**What it is**: Select whether you want to make changes to the existing set of feed items or wipe the existing set clean and start over with what you upload.

**What you need to know**:
- **Update**: Use this if you want to add, change, or remove values of **some** of your ad customizer feed's items. Feed items not listed in your upload will not be affected.
  - Make sure to include the **Action** and **Item ID** columns of your feed, as shown in the below template.
  - In the **Action** column, enter either **Add**, **Set**, or **Remove**, depending on your desired action.

- **Replace**: Use this to replace **all** of your ad customizer feed's items. Note: The columns of your uploaded spreadsheet must match the columns of your previous feed.
