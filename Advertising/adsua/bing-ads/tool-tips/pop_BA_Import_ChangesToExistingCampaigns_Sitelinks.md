# Import sitelinks

When we import your Sitelink Extensions, we look at each and the links it contains. If you have identical sets of Sitelink Extensions that you're using among more than one campaign, to make managing these easier for you, we'll simply share this set between these campaigns. This means that later on, if you make a change to this Sitelink Extension, the change will affect all campaigns where you're using it.

If you choose not to share identical sets of Sitelink Extensions between campaigns, we'll create a separate set for each campaign. These sets will all look the same, but after import, you'll be able to edit each Sitelink Extension separately.
