# Revenue value

**What it is:**  A monetary value that you assign to this conversion. You enter the amount and currency for specific accounts and only the amount for all accounts. The currency for all accounts will be determined based on the account currency to which the conversion was attributed. The amount can be any value from 0 to 999999999999 with 3 decimal fields (for example, 111.001).

**Why it's important:**     If you assign values to your conversions, you'll be able to see the total value driven by your advertising across different conversions, rather than simply the number of conversions that have happened.

**What you need to know:**     For destination URL and event conversion goals, you have two types of revenue you can assign:
**Each time it happens, the conversion action has the same value** checkbox, and then enter the amount and select the currency. This is a static revenue value that doesn't change.

**The value of this conversion action may vary (for instance, by purchase price)** checkbox, and then enter the default amount and select the default currency to be used when no value is received for a conversion. The revenue value will change based on the customization you make to the UET tag tracking code that you add to your website. To learn more, see [How to report variable revenue with UET](../hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2RevenueVariables.md). This option is only available for destination URL and event conversion goals.

The other conversion goals only have the same value option.
