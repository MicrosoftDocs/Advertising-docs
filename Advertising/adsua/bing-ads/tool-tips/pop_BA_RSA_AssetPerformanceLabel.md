# Asset performance rating

**What it is:**  This lets you know how well the assets you set up for your responsive search ads are performing.

**What you need to know:**  There are five performance ratings for your assets:
- **Low**: This asset's performance is low and we recommend you replace this asset to improve your ad performance.
- **Good**: This asset is performing well. We recommend you keep this asset and add more assets to improve your ad performance.
- **Best**: This asset's performance is among the best and we recommend that you add more similar assets.
- **Unrated**: We don't have any performance rating for this asset. This can be due to the asset being inactive, not having enough information to determine its performance, or if there aren't enough similar assets to compare against it.
- **Learning**: The asset's performance is being actively evaluated. Once the evaluation is complete, the asset rating will be Low, Good, Best, or Unrated.
