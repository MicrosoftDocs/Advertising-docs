# Business location

Enter the  address for your business locations and then use this information to target your ads to a specific location. To learn how, see [Using targeting to display your ads to the right people](../hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md).

When you create a business location, you are required to enter your business name and address.  You can also enter a phone number, an email address, description about the location, and add an icon that represents your business.
