# Compare in graph only

**What it is:**     Compare data across two different date ranges. On the Audiences, Change History, and Dimensions tabs, you see the comparison in the graph only, and not in the table.

**What you need to know:**     You can see the comparison in the graph and in the table on the Campaigns, Ad Groups, Ads, Keywords, and Ad Extensions tabs.
