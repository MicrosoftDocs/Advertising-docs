# Location ID

**What it is**: The number Microsoft Advertising uses to identify the location the ad was served, or that your customer had shown interest in through searches or content they had viewed.

**Why it's important**: This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
