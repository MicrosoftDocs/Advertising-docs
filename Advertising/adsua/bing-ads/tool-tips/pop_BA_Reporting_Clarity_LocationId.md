# Location ID

**What it is** : The number Microsoft Advertising uses to identify the location the ad was served, or that your customer had shown interest in through searches or content they had viewed.

**Why it's important** : This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
