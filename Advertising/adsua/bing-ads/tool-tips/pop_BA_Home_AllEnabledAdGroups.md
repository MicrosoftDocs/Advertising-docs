# All enabled ad groups

**What it shows:**  The key metrics for all active ad groups including impressions, impression share (%), clicks, spend, and average cost-per-click.

**Why review it:**  It filters your ad groups to just the ones that are active so you can review the performance quickly to identify top performing or low performing ones. This is also a quick way to flag any major ad group problems.
