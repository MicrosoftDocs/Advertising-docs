# Max. CPC

**What it is:** Max. CPC, the maximum cost-per-click that you are willing to pay for a keyword, is equivalent to the keyword bid. This does not include any bid adjustments you have made, so keep in mind that total spend could be higher. The keyword bid can be made for all keywords in an ad group or custom bids can be made for some or all of your keywords.

**What you need to know:** You bid on keywords to get your ads to show up on search results pages and Windows apps (US only). The position of your ad is determined by how your bid compares with other bids for that keyword.
