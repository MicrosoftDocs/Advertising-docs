# Day and time

**What it is** : This is the day or time of day that you are targeting.

**What you need to know** : When in the **Ad group level** view, the values in this column can appear in either gray text or black text. Here's what that means:
- **Gray text** : This is a **campaign level** target. In other words, this ad group has inherited this target from its campaign's targeting settings.
- **Black text** : This is an **ad group level** target. In other words, you have added or changed this target for this particular ad group.

**Note** : You can make changes to an inherited target (gray text) in the **Ad group level** view and it will become an ad group level target (black text). Keep in mind that, going forward, you will need to manage this setting independently of your campaign level settings.
