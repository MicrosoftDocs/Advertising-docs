# Day of week

**What it is:**     A number that tells you which day of the week your data is from.      Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 3, Wednesday = 4, Thursday = 5, Friday = 6, Saturday = 7

**Why itâ€™s important:**     You can use this information to identify if there is a specific day of the week where you get more traffic and then you can use bid adjustments to target that day of week.
