# Payment setting

**What it is:**    There are two payment settings.

- **Prepay.**  You pay in advance for your ads. As your ads are clicked, we'll deduct money from your account balance. When your account balance gets low, you can make another prepayment to keep your ads running.
- **Postpay.**  You pay after your ads are clicked. Postpay accounts are either threshold (you automatically pay at the end of your monthly billing cycle or when you reach your threshold, whichever comes first) or monthly invoice.
