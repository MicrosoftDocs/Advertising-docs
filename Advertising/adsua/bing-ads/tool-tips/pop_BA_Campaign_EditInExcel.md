# Edit in Excel Web App

Here are a few things you should know about using the Excel Web App to edit your keywords:

**Editing.** You can change match type, bid, parameters, destination URL, and status. Changes to other columns, which are shaded grey, will not be saved.

**Adding.** If you add a new keyword, you'll need to include campaign name, ad group ID, ad group name, match type, and bid. (These mandatory columns use red text in the headings.)

**Deleting.** Deleting the keyword or the keyword row from Excel will not delete the keyword from Microsoft Advertising. Instead, to delete a keyword, change the status column to deleted.

**Saving.** To save your changes to Microsoft Advertising, click **File** and then **Exit**. Do not click **Save** or **Save As** on the Excel file menu.
