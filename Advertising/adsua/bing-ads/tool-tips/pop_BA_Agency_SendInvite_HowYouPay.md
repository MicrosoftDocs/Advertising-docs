# How you pay

**What it is:**  Since you have opted to pay the bills, you can decide whether to pay in advance (prepay) or after charges have accrued (postpay threshold or monthly invoice).

**What you need to know:**

- If you select **prepay account** , you'll need to add funds for the account to be active. If the client has a balance it will be refunded to them.
- If you want to pay by **monthly invoice billing** , you can [learn how to apply here](../hlp_BA_PROC_MonthlyInvoiceApply.md).
