# How you pay

**What it is: ** Since you are opting to pay the bills, you can decide whether to pay in advance (prepay) or after charges have accrued (postpay threshold or monthly invoice).

**What you need to know: **

- If you select **prepay account**, you'll need to add funds for the account to be active. If the account has a balance, we will refund it to the current bill-to customer.
- If you want to pay by **monthly invoice** billing, you can [learn how to apply here](../hlp_BA_PROC_MonthlyInvoiceApply.md).
