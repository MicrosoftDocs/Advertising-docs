# Estimated monthly clicks

**What it is** : This is the number of times customers are expected to click the ads in this ad group every month, given the bid value you have set.

**What you need to know** : Clicks are what you pay for. They typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).
