# Final URL suffix

**What it is** : A place in your final URL where you can add parameters that will be attached to the end of your landing page URL, from the keyword level up to the account level.

**Why it's important** : We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your tracking parameters are always sent to the landing page.
