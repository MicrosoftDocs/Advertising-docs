# Delete items that have been removed from your Google Ads account

**What it is**: Removed Google Ads items will be deleted along with their associated sub-items. For example, if you previously removed a Google Ads campaign, its ads groups, ads, and keywords will also be deleted during this import.

**What you need to know**: Ad extensions removed in Google Ads will not be deleted in Microsoft Advertising during this import.
