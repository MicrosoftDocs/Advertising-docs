# Images

**What it is** : This is where you choose the imagery that you want to appear in your ad.

**Why it's important** : At least one image is required. The ad's imagery and overall appearance adjust responsively so it can blend in across a variety of publishers and placements.

**What you need to know** :
- When you upload an image, we create multiple versions of it, each with a different aspect ratio. You can recrop any aspect-ratio image—or change it to a different image entirely—by hovering over the image and selecting **Edit**.
- As you add or edit images, the Ad preview area on the right side of the page will update to give you an idea of what your ad could look like. Select the arrows on either side of the Ad preview area to scroll through the different possible placements in various properties. These ad previews are examples of how your ads could appear. Depending on placement, the actual ad shown may appear differently.
