# How do I remove the hold?

In this column, you will see one of three ways that you can remove the hold:

**Fix declined payments:**  Click this and weâ€™ll walk you through the process of (1) updating your primary payment method or using a different primary payment method, and (2) paying your account balance. Once your account balance is paid, the hold will be removed and your ads will be eligible to run. This process can take up to 30 minutes. **Note:** If the **Fix declined payments** button is disabled, then you do not have the correct permissions to fix the hold. Someone with full account permissions (a Super Admin) will need to remove the hold.

**Contact support:**  For the hold to be removed, we need you to contact us, either through chat or by phone.

**Contact bill-to customer:**  Another company or agency is responsible for paying the charges on your account. There is a problem with the payment method they are using or they have overdue payments. Contact the bill-to customer and ask them to remove the hold.
