# Increase keyword, ad group, and auto target bids to Microsoft Advertising minimum

**      What it is:**     Due to differences in Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads minimum bid requirements, any bids below the our minimum amount will automatically be raised during import.

**      Why it's important:**     This means that the amount of money you spend overall may increase for the imported campaigns.

**      What you need to know:**     If you decide to opt out of increasing the minimum bid during import, any campaigns that don’t meet the minimum amount will not get imported.
