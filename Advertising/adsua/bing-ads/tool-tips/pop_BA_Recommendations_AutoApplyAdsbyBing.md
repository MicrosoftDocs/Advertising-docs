# Auto-apply ads by Bing

**What it is:** With this option enabled, Microsoft Advertising will automatically create and apply suggested ads to your account.

**What you need to know:** You have a two-week review period to edit, decline, or directly apply automated ads to your account. Otherwise, they apply automatically to your account.

**Why it's important:** Ad groups with three or more quality ads tend to perform better than those with one or none. Automated ads are created for ad groups that show potential for better performance.
