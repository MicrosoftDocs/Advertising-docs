# Who pays

**What it is:** The agency has chosen to either pay the account charges ( become the **bill-to customer**) or have you continue to pay the account charges.

**What you need to know:** If the agency pays the account charges and you have a prepay account with a balance, we will refund your balance to your original payment method. If for some reason that refund fails, we will send you a check or wire transfer, depending on the country of your account. Please keep in mind that checks can take up to 5 weeks for you to receive.
