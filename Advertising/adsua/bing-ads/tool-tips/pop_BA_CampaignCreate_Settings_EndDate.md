# End date

**What it is:**        The day you want your ads to stop running.

**What you need to know:**     If you leave this field blank, your ads will run indefinitely (unless there is an account error). When you select an end date, your ad group will run through the day before it. For example, if your selected end date is Jan 31, your ads will run through Jan 30 and then stop.
