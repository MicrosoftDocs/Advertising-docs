# Click-through rate (CTR)

**What it is: **        The number of times an ad was clicked divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions) during this period. For example, if your ads had 50 clicks out of 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13%.

**Why it's important: **       CTR is a good way to quickly judge the effectiveness of your ad copy.
