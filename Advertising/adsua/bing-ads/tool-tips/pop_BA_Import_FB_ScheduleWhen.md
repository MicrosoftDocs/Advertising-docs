# When

**What it is:**  This is the schedule for when you want the import to happen.

**What you need to know:**  The scheduling options are:

- **Auto:** Allows Microsoft Advertising to set an import schedule to best optimize your campaigns.
- **Now:**  Import happens as soon as you click the Import button and only runs once.
- **Once:**  Import happens at the time you specify and only runs once.
- **Daily:**  Import happens once a day at the time you specify.
- **Weekly:**  Import happens once a week at the time you specify.
- **Monthly:**  Import happens once a month at the time you specify.

**Note:**  If you check the **Run Now** box the import runs now in addition to the scheduling option you chose.

**TIP:** You can change the import schedule anytime. From the global menu at the top of the page, select **Import** > **Import schedule **&amp;** history** to review more scheduling options.
