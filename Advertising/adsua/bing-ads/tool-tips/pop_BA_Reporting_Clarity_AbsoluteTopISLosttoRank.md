# Absolute top impression share lost to rank (%)

**What it is:**  The estimated percentage of how often poor ad rank kept your ad from showing in the first ad position at the top of search results.

**Why it's important:** Use this data to help you assess reasons your ads are missing out on the top ad position, which is more likely to win clicks and conversions.

**What you need to know:** Ad rank determines where your ad shows relative to other ads, based on factors including your bid amount, ad performance, ad relevance, ad extensions, other competing ads, and more.
