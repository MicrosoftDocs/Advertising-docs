# Benchmark CTR

**What it is: **    Shows you how other product ads for similar products are performing, on average, based on how often people who see the ad end up clicking on it.

**Why itâ€™s important: **   If the benchmark CTR is significantly higher than the CTR for your product group, you might consider raising your bid for that product group, or improving the product information, particularly product images and titles.
