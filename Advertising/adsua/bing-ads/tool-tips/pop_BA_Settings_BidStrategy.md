# Bid strategy

**What it is** : How you want to manage your bids.

**What you need to know** : You can choose from one of these bid strategy options:
- **Manual CPC** : You set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising uses these bids every time.
- **Enhanced CPC** : Microsoft Advertising automatically adjusts your bids in real time to increase your chances for a conversion.
- **Maximize Clicks** : Microsoft Advertising automatically sets your bids in real time to get as many **clicks** as possible within your budget.
- **Maximize Conversions** : Microsoft Advertising automatically sets your bids in real time to get as many **conversions** as possible within your budget.
- **Target CPA** : You set your budget and your target 30-day average CPA (cost per acquisition), and Microsoft Advertising automatically sets your bids in real time to get you to this average.
- **Target ROAS** : You set your budget and your target 30-day average ROAS (return on ad spend), and Microsoft Advertising automatically sets your bids in real time to get you to this average.  **Not everyone has this feature yet.**

**Note** : Any bid adjustments you have set now or in the future can be used to inform your Maximize Clicks, Maximize Conversions, Target CPA, or Target ROAS automated bids.
