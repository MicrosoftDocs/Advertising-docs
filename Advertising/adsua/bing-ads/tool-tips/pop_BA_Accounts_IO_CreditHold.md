# Why is my account on hold?

An account can be placed on **Hold** for a number of reasons. The most common for invoiced accounts are:

- We have not yet approved your account for invoice billing.
- You have reached your credit limit for the month, and your payment is due or in process.
- You have reached your total approved credit limit.
