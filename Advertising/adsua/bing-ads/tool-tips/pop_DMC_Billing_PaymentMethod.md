# Payment for search advertising

**What it is:**
- To pay for search advertising in Microsoft Advertising, you must have a credit or debit card as your **Primary payment method**.
- You can add a **Backup payment method** that will be charged if a payment charged to your primary payment method is unsuccessful.
- If you’d like to add another card, you can add it as an **Additional payment method**. Please note, unlike a backup payment method, an additional payment method will not be charged if a payment using your primary payment method is unsuccessful.

**What you need to know:**
- You cannot remove your primary card without replacing it. If you only have one card in Microsoft Advertising, add another card, and assign it as the new primary card. Once that is updated, you can remove your previous primary card.
- Microsoft Advertising accepts credit and debit cards only (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Network). We do not accept payments by prepaid cards.
