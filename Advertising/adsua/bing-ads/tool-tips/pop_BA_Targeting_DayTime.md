# Target by day and time

**What it is:**  By default, your ads are eligible to display every day of the week, 24 hours a day. However, you might want to limit advertising to those times that you know your        target customer will be searching for your products or services, so that you aren't paying for clicks that won't lead to conversions.

**Example:**  Your customers are searching for your products while they are at work. You target Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and your ad will only show during those days and times.

**What you need to know:**  You can choose to have your ad schedule based on the time zone of your business location or on the time zone of your customers' location.
