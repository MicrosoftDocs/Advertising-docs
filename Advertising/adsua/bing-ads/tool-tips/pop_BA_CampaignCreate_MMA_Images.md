# Images

**What it is** : This is where you choose the imagery that you want to appear in your ad.

**Why it's important** : You need to choose at least one image with 1.19:1 aspect ratio and one image with 1:1 aspect ratio before saving your ad. The ad's imagery and overall appearance adjust responsively so it can blend in across different ad placements.

**What you need to know** :
- When you upload an image, we create multiple versions of it, each with a different aspect ratio: 1.91:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 4:1.
- You can re-crop any aspect-ratio image by selecting **Edit placement** from the Ad preview area. You can also choose to add Smart effects to your image in the Edit placement panel.
- Select **Include** to use an image in a new aspect ratio or **Exclude** to use a different image.
- The Ad preview area will give you an idea of what your ad could look like, depending on the different aspect ratios. Select the arrows on either side of the Ad preview area to scroll through the different possible layouts. Depending on placement, the actual ad shown may appear differently.
