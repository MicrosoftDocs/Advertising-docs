# Billing threshold

**What it is:** [!INCLUDE [BillingThresholdDef](../includes/BillingThresholdDef.md)]

**How it works:** [!INCLUDE [BillingThresholdProcess](../includes/BillingThresholdProcess.md)]

**What you need to know:**

- [!INCLUDE [BillingThresholdLimit](BillingThresholdLimit)]
- Charges can exceed the billing threshold or your limit by a small amount. If you are setting the limit because of a maximum amount you can charge on your credit card or PayPal account, you should set your limit slightly below that amount.
- If you set your limit below your current balance, we will charge you the full balance. After that, you will be charged your limit (or a slightly larger amount).
- You need Super Admin permissions to change the billing threshold.
