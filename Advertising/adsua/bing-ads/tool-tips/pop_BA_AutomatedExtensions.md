# Automated Extensions

**What it is** : If an Automated Extension can improve your ad performance, Microsoft Advertising will automatically display extra details about your business below your ad.

**What you need to know** : All advertisers are eligible for automated extensions, however, they are not always guaranteed to show in the ads. If two competing ads have the same bid and quality, the ad with greater expected impact from ad extensions and automated extensions will generally appear in a higher ad position than the other. Automated extensions will be applied to your ads, unless you opt out.
