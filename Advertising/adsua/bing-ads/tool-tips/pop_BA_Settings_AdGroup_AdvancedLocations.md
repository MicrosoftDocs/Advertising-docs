# Advanced location options

**What it is: **     These options allow you to choose whether or not to show your ads to people who are physically in your targeted location as well as people outside of your area who search for or view webpages about your targeted location.

**What you should know:**     These options are only available here if you are **not** using your campaign settings for this ad group's location targeting.
