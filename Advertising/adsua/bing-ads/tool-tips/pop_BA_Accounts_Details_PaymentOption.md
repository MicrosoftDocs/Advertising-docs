# Payment option

For postpay accounts, there are two payment options.

- **Threshold.** We bill you automatically when your account reaches a certain amount (threshold), or at the end of your billing cycle, whichever comes first.   All new accounts are automatically set to threshold billing. Billing thresholds can increase over time, and you can put a limit on your billing threshold.
- **Monthly invoice. **We send you a bill at the end of your billing cycle every month. Customers who are invoiced on monthly basis must meet certain qualifications.      If you don't see this option listed here      and you are interested in finding out whether you qualify, you can [learn more and apply here](../hlp_BA_PROC_MonthlyInvoiceApply.md).

To learn more, see [How we bill you](../hlp_BA_CONC_HowBillingWorks.md).
