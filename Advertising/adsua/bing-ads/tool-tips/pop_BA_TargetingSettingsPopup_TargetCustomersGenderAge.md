# Target by gender and age

From **Settings**, you can target          your ads to specific genders and certain age groups by adding an extra bid, known as a [bid adjustment](../hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md),          to your base bid to increase the chance that your ads are displayed in a good position to potential customers in your targeted gender or age group.          Remember that using bid adjustments can make your **actual** final monthly spend greater than the maximum **estimated** spend.

> If you are creating a new campaign or ad group, you do not see the bid adjustment options.
