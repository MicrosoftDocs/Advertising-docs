# CTR (Broad match)

**What it is:**  The number of times an ad was clicked divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions) by a broad match type. For example, if an advertiser's ad had 50 clicks out of 2,348 impressions, their CTR is 2.13%.

**Why it's important:**  CTR is a good way to quickly judge the effectiveness of an advertiser's ad copy.
