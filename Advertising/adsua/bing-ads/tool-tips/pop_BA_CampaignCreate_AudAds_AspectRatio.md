# Aspect ratio

**What it is** : This is the proportion between the width and height of each image.

**What you need to know** : Microsoft Advertising automatically crops the image you upload into all the possible aspect ratios necessary for the different audience ad placements. You can re-crop (or replace entirely) any individual aspect-ratio image: Just hover over the image, select **Edit**, and then select either **Re-crop** or **Replace**.
