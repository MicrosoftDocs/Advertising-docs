# Top impression share (%)

**What it is:** The percentage of impressions for your ad in the mainline, the top ad placements above the search results, out of the estimated number of mainline impressions you were eligible to receive.

**Why it’s important:**   A lower number indicates there might be something about your ad’s eligibility that affects its position.

**What you need to know:**  Eligibility for top impression is based on your ad's approval status, quality score, targeting settings, and bids.
