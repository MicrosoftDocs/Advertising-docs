# Tax information

**What it is:**  If you have added a tax ID or VAT registration number, it will be listed in this column.

**Why is it important:**  In some business locations, Microsoft Advertising is required to charge tax or VAT unless you provide a tax ID, VAT registration number, or VAT exemption certificate.

**If you see:**

- **A dash (-)**, you haven’t provided any tax or VAT information.
- **Pending**, verification of your information is in process.
- **Invalid**, the information you provided is not accurate and needs to be updated.
- **No taxes apply**, because (1) we have your tax/VAT information on file, (2) the local tax rate is 0%, or (3) Microsoft Advertising does not charge taxes in that business location.
- **Taxes apply**, Microsoft Advertising is required to charge taxes in that business location.
