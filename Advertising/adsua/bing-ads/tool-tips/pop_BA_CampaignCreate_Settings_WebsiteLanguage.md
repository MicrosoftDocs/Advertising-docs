# Website language

**What it is**: This is the language of the content in your website.

**What you need to know**:
- Your website language determines where your ads are eligible to appear. For example, a German-language ad can appear in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but not in Spain.
- You can also narrow the locations where your ads will appear using location targeting.
- Once you select and save your website language, you won't be able to change it.
- If your website contains pages in multiple languages and you want to advertise all of these pages, you should create a separate campaign for each language.
