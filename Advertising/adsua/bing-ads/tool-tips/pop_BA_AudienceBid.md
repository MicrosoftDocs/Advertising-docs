# Bid only

**What it is:**   If you choose this option, we will continue to deliver ads to everyone included in your ad groups before, however once you associate an audience with an ad group, you can increase or decrease your bid amount for people included in the audience. Microsoft Advertising will increase/decrease the bid amount when users in the audiences come back to the Microsoft Search Network to search for your keywords or visit sites on Microsoft Audience Network.

**Why it's important:**   This setting helps you bid more (or less) aggressively for the people included in the audiences.
