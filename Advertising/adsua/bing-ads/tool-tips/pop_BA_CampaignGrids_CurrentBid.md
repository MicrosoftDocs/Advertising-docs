# Bid

**What it is: **       Your bid is the maximum cost-per-click that you are willing to pay for a keyword. (It does not include any bid adjustments you have made, so total spend could be higher.) Keyword bids can be made for all keywords in an ad group or custom bids can be made for some or all of your keywords.

**Why it's important: **       You bid on keywords to get your ads to show up on search results pages and in Windows apps (US only). The position of your ad is determined by how your bid compares with other bids for that keyword.
