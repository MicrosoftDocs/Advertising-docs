# Estimated all conversions

**What it is:**     The estimated total of all conversions, which are the clicks that result in a sale or another measure of success, to a particular age group or gender. All conversions means every conversion is counted, regardless of whether or not **Include in "Conversions"** is selected for this conversion goal.

**What you need to know:**     This value is an estimate because age and gender are not known for the entire audience.
