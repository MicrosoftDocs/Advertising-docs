# Countdown syntax

**What it is** : This shows you how the countdown tag will appear in your title or ad text field.

**What you need to know** : When your ad appears on a search results page, the tag will be replaced by text such as "3 days," "13 hours," or "37 minutes," depending on your end date and settings.
