# Expert mode for professional marketers

**What it is:**     Expert mode gives you more control over Microsoft Advertising campaign management and reporting; for example, additional ad types, audience targeting, conversion goals, and performance reports. You can also import from Google Ads and Facebook Ads in an expert account.

**What you need to know:**       Switch to expert mode if you have experience with search engine marketing, are an agency, or you want to target customers outside the US, AU, and UK.
