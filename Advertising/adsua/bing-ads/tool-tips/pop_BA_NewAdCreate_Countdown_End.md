# Countdown ends

**What it is** : This is the date and time your ad's countdown will count down to. When this date and time is reached, the ad will stop running.

**What you need to know** : When your ad appears on a search results page, the countdown tag will be replaced by text such as "3 days," "13 hours," or "37 minutes," depending on this end date and your other settings.

**Tip** :  At any point after an ad's countdown has expired and the ad has stopped showing, you can change this date and time to a point in the future to restart the ad.
