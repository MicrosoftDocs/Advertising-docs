# Postal code

**What it is:**     The postal code or zip code where an ad was physically served, or that your customer had shown interest in through searches or content they had viewed.

**Why it’s important:**     This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
