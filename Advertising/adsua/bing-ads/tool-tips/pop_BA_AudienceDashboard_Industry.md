# Industry

**What it is** : With industry targeting, you can target your ads to be more (or less) likely to appear for people who most recently worked in specific industries (according to their LinkedIn profiles).

**Note** : As you add and edit targets, pay attention to the audience meter on the right side of the page. If your targeting becomes too narrow, you won't be able to save your campaign.
