# Set payment type

**What it is:** Setting your payment method to the option you want.

**What you need to know:**
- You cannot remove your primary card without replacing it. If you only have one card in Microsoft Advertising, add another card, and assign it as the new primary card. Once that is updated, you can remove your previous primary card.
- Microsoft Advertising accepts credit and debit cards only (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Network). We do not accept payments by prepaid cards.
