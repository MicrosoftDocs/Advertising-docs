# Accounts payable contact

**What it is:**     An accounts payable contact receives monthly invoices and the Statement of Account, which provides an overview of open invoices and recent payment activity. If there is ever an issue with payment, Microsoft Advertising will use the information on file to reach out to the accounts payable contact.

**What you need to know:**
- Super Admins can add anyone as an accounts payable contact â€” including those without a Microsoft Advertising account.
- To add a contact who isn't an existing Microsoft Advertising user: the contact will receive an email to verify their email address. Upon confirmation, the user will be added as an accounts payable contact.
- To add a contact who is an existing Microsoft Advertising user: There is no additional verification step required, because Microsoft Advertising already has an email address on file for an existing user.
