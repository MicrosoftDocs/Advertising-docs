# Insertion order's purchase order

**What it is:**     An ID you enter when you create an insertion order that can be used for tracking purposes.

**What you need to know:**
- [!INCLUDE [AccountsSummary_IO_Note1](../includes/AccountsSummary_IO_Note1.md)]
- Purchase orders are optional, so if you didn’t enter a purchase order, you’ll see dashes in the table.
