# SSL Checkout

- **What it is:** Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is technology that is used to protect your customers' information by encrypting data that travels between a web browser and a web server. URLs that start with https: rather than http: and have a lock icon in the browser are secured with SSL.
- **What you need to know:** All Microsoft Advertising Merchant Stores must have SSL log-in and checkout pages. Verify that your SSL certificates are valid, as Microsoft Advertising will reject stores that are not SSL-enabled.
