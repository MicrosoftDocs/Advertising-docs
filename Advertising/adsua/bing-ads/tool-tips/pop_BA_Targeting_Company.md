# Company

**What it is** : With company targeting, you can target your ads to be more (or less) likely to appear for people who most recently worked at specific companies (according to their LinkedIn profiles).

**What you need to know** : Make a bid adjustment to increase or decrease the likelihood of your ad appearing for people who work at specific companies. You can increase each bid up to 900% or decrease it up to 90%.
