# Assets

**What it is:**  Assets are headlines and descriptions you provide, and using these, Microsoft Advertising will mix and match the most optimal combinations to create effective ads.

**What you need to know:**

- **Existing assets** were previously created by you or taken from existing text ads within this ad group.
- **AI-generated assets** are customized recommendations based on headlines and descriptions from your own active ads in the same ad group, as well as your historical performance, campaign settings, and trends.
