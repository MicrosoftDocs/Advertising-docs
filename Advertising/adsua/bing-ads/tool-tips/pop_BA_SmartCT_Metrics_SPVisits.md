# Total visits to special pages

**What it is** : This is the total number of visits to your special pages from customers who clicked your ad (during the selected date range).

**What you need to know** :
- Data collection begins after you add the Microsoft Advertising tracking tag to your website's code.
- A dash (—) displays if there's no data available for the selected date range—either because the selected date range is before you set up customer action tracking or because you received no traffic from your ad in this date range.
