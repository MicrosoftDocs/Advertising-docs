# Ad description 2

**What it is:**        The second section of body text that appears below the title and site URL in your ad. If your ad doesn't include this text, the Ad description 2 column returns empty.

**Why it's important:**        The ad description is the main text of the ad, allowing more character space to speak to customers than in the ad title. Find out what text approach works best for your goals.

**What you need to know:** 	   Ad text cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
