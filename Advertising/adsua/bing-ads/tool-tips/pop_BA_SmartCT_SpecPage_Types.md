# Suggested page types

**What it is**: These are categories of pages you may have on your website.

**Why it's important**: Our suggested page types can help you organize and identify your special pages.

**What you need to know**: When you create a special page, you can add a single page with a specific URL, or a group of pages that either contain or begin with a phrase in the URL.
