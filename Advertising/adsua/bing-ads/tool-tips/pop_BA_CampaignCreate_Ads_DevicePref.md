# Device preference

**What it is:** The option to prefer that your ads appear on mobile devices.

**Why it's important:** By selecting mobile device preference, you're requesting that this ad appear specifically for customers using mobile devices. Whether your ad only shows on mobile devices depends on a number of things, including your ad group device preferences and whether you have other ads in your ad group.
