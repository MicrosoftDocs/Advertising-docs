# Bid only

**What it is** : If you choose this option, we will deliver ads to everyone who meets your other targeting criteria, while letting you make bid adjustments for specific job functions.

**Why it's important** : This setting lets you bid more (or less) aggressively for the people who meet specific job function criteria, without restricting your ads to those people.
