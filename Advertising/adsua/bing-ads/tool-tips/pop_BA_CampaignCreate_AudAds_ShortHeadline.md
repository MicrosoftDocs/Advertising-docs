# Short headline

**What it is** : This is one of the headlines that could appear in your ad.

**Why it's important** : Headlines are the most prominent text that appears in your ad, so you should make the most out of the available characters. We require multiple headlines so the ad can flexibly display across a variety of publishers and placements.

**Note** : A headline cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
