# Size: Search network

**What it is** : This column shows how many people in your audience could be reached on the search network. These people recently interacted with your website, met the rules defined in the list, and were active on the search network during your membership duration.

**What you need to know** : There are a few items that can impact your list size:
- After you create the audience or edit the **Membership duration**, **Whom to add to your list**, or **Tag name** sections, or have imported new custom audiences from DMP, it takes 24 hours to build it. The list size column will show a dash **"-"** while the audience is being built.
- If the UET tag associated with the audience has a status of **Unverified**, the audience can't receive the customer information from your website that it needs to build the audience.        The list size column will show a dash **"-"**.
- The audience needs to have at least 300 people on the search network in order for it to be eligible to serve.

**Why it's important** : This gives you an idea of how many people you can target with this audience.
