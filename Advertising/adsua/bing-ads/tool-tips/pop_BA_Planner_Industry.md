# Industry benchmarking

**What it is:**  Industry benchmarking lets you compare your campaign performance to the industry average. Select the campaign you want to compare and the industry you want to compare it to.

**Why it's important:**  You can compare your campaign performance to the industry average and then optimize your campaign. For example, if the impression trend for the industry is higher, you can research and add more keywords to try to increase your impressions.
