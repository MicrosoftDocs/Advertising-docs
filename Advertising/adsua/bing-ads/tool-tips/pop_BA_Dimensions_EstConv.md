# Estimated conversions

**What it is:**    The estimated number of conversions, which are the clicks that results in a sale or another measure of success, to a particular age group or gender. Conversions are measured by adding a small bit of code to your website pages so that a visitorâ€™s progress through your site can be tracked.

**What you need to know: **    This value is an estimate because the age and gender is not known for the entire audience.
