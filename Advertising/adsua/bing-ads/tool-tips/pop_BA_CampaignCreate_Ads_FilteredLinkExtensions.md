# Filter Link Extensions

**What it is:**  If you have multiple products, services or offerings that have dedicated pages on your website, the Filter Link extension offers a way to surface those links directly in your search ad.

**What you need to know:**  Use Filter Link Extensions to list multiple categories of products or features with unique links to each of these offerings. Easily combined with other extensions, Filter Link Extensions can enlarge your ad format even further and present multiple avenues to different parts of your site, in addition to your final URL.
