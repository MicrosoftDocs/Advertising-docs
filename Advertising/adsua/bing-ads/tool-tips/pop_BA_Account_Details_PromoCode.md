# Promotional offer

**What it is: **We often run promotions that offer coupons to new customers so that they can try out Microsoft Advertising.

**What you need to know: **

- To redeem a promotional code, you need to have a primary payment method.
- It can take up to 10 minutes after you add the coupon before the balance appears in your account. If your account and campaign are active and there are clicks on your ads during this period, we will charge your primary payment method.
- To keep your ads running after your coupon is depleted or expires, we'll charge your primary payment method (postpay account) or deduct funds (prepay account).
- Once a coupon is redeemed, you must use the coupon within 90 days or by the expiration date, whichever comes first.
- You can only use coupons for future advertising charges, not to pay for an existing amount due.
