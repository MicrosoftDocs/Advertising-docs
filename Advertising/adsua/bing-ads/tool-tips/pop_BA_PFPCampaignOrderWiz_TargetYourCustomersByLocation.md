# Location targeting

**          What is location targeting?**  Specify where you want your ads to show as well as        where you don't want them to show (excluded locations).

**Why is it important?**  Location targeting helps you         [get your ads in front of the right people](../hlp_BA_CONC_Targeting.md), so that you aren't paying for clicks from people who can't buy your products or use your services.         For example, if you sell your products only in Australia and New Zealand, you should target those two countries.         However, if you own an auto repair shop in Auckland, you should target that city.

**How does location targeting work?** &nbsp;Microsoft Advertising looks at your ad language, location targets, and advanced location options to determine where your ad should be        delivered.         For details, see [How does location and language impact who can see my ads?](../hlp_BA_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)

**What you need to know:**  You cannot target locations by zip code if you are using third party or custom tools to manage your campaign.
