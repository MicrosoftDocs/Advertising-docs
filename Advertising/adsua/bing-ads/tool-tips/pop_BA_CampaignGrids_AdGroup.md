# Ad group

**What it is:**         Ad groups contain one or more closely related ads and the keywords associated with those ads. You can have multiple ad groups in each of your campaigns.

**Why it's important:**       Ad groups are an essential part of organizing your campaign. You should include only closely related keywords and ads in each ad group. This allows you to create ads that are highly relevant to that group's keywords. The more relevant the ad, the more likely it is to display.
