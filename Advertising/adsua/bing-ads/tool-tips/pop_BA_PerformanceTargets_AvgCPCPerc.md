# Average cost-per-click (CPC) percentage

**What it is:**     The % ratio of the average CPC compared to the target average CPC.

**What you need to know:**    You can use this percentage to gauge whether you’re over paying for a click.

**For example:**   If your target was $1.00 per click, and your current average is $0.75 per click, you’re paying below your target.
