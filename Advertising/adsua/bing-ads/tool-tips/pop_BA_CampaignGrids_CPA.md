# Cost per acquisition (CPA)

**What it is** : The total spend divided by conversions that are attributable to the ad. A conversion, or acquisition, is something that you want to happen after someone clicks your ad, 	   for example, purchasing a product or registering for your site.

**What you need to know** : The total spend in this metric only includes spend from clicks that could lead to conversions.

**Why it's important** : Although you cannot bid based on cost per acquisition, you can still track the cost of your conversions.
