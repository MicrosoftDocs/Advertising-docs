# Bids and budgets

**What it is:**  Both Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads offer you the ability to limit your campaign spend on a daily basis.

**What you need to know:** Microsoft Advertising has different minimum bid and budget requirements than Google Ads. To help you import all of your data quickly, we will, by default, raise any bids and budgets that are too low to meet the our minimums. This means that the amount of money you spend overall may increase on the items you import into Microsoft Advertising. Keep in the mind that while you can opt out of these increases by clearing these checkboxes, the campaigns that don’t meet these minimums won’t get imported. To review the minimum bids that Microsoft Advertising supports, see [What gets imported](../hlp_BA_CONC_ImportWhatInfo.md).
