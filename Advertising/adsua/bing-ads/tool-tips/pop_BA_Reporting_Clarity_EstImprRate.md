# Estimated impression rate (%)

**What it is:**   The estimated number of times that an ad will be clicked by a particular age group or gender, divided by the total number of estimated impressions across the ad group    (including estimated impressions for unknown age and gender demographics). The value is expressed as a percentage.

**What you need to know:** This value is an estimate because age and gender are not known for the entire audience.
