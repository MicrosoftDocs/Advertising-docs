# Do not expand unsupported location targets

**What it is** : During an import, we match your Google Ads location targets to those currently in Microsoft Advertising. If certain location targets are unsupported, we automatically expand their scope to map them with parent locations targets that **are** supported.

**What you need to know** : When enabled, this option allows you to opt out of expanding unsupported location targets, and not include them in this import.
