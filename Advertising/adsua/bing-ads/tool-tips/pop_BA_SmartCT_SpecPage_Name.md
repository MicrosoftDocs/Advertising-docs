# Special page name

**What it is** : A unique name to identify this page.

**What you need to know** :
- Each page name must be unique. If you have more than one page of the same page type (such as multiple product pages), the unique page name can help you identify each page when you're viewing metrics on your campaign's home page.
- You can view detailed metrics for these pages on the **Customer action tracking** pane.
