# Device preference

**What it is:**  The option to select mobile as your device preference.

**Why it's important:**  You can create app extensions specifically for customers using mobile devices.

**What you need to know:**  Microsoft Advertising will apply your mobile device preference, as long as both mobile and non-mobile preferred app extensions are associated with the campaign/ad group.
