# Ad text

**What it is** : This text will appear below or adjacent to your ad's long or short headline, depending on the ad placement.

**Why it's important** : Once the imagery and headlines have a potential customer's attention, the ad text needs to convince them to click it. What sets your product or service apart?

**Note** : Ad text cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
