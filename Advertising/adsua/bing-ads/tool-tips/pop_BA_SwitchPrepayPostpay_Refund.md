# Postpay account refund

**What it is:** If your postpay account has a negative account balance (we owe you money based on a credit), we will refund the amount before we can switch you to prepay.

**What you need to know:**   We will try to process your refund using the same payment method that you used to initially make the prepayment to your account. If we run into problems, we will send a check issued to your company and mailed to your company address. Please give us 2-3 weeks to process the check, and then allow additional time for delivery by postal mail.
