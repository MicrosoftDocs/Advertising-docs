# Product group bids

**      What it is:**     By selecting this option, Microsoft Advertising will increase all product group bids to the recommended minimum bid amount.

**      What you need to know:**     Your campaigns will still be imported if you donâ€™t select this option but any products groups that have a bid below the Microsoft Advertising minimum will not serve.
