# Location targeting

**What it is** : With location targeting, you specify where you want your ads to appear as well as where you don't want them to appear (excluded locations).

**Why it's important** : Location targeting helps you get your ads in front of the right people, so that you aren't paying for clicks from people who can't buy your products or use your services. For example, if you sell your products only in Australia and New Zealand, you should target those two countries. However, if you own an auto repair shop in Auckland, you should target that city.

**How does location targeting work?** &nbsp;Microsoft Advertising looks at your ad language, location targets, and advanced location options to determine where your ad should be delivered. For details, see  [How does location and language impact who can see my ads?](../hlp_BA_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)

**What you need to know** : By default, an ad group uses its campaign's location targeting. To set different location targeting for an ad group, uncheck the **Use my campaign settings** checkbox.

**Managing radius targets** : Many smaller locations have radius targets by default. To change or remove this radius, click on the location name after you have added it. Note that:
- For some locations, radius targeting is the only available option.
- For larger locations (such as metro areas), radius targeting is not an option.
