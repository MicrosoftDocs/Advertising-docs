# Average cost-per-view (CPV)

**What it is**: The total cost of all views or clicks divided by the number of views during this period. This is the average amount youâ€™re charged each time your ad is viewed or clicked, whichever happens first.

**What you need to know**: This is a good way to measure user engagement with the brand message and judge the effectiveness of your video messaging.
