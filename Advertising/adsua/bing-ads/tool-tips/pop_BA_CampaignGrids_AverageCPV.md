# Average cost-per-view (CPV)

**What it is** : The total cost of all views or clicks divided by the number of views during this period. This is the average amount you’re charged each time your ad is viewed or clicked, whichever happens first.

**What you need to know** : This is a good way to measure user engagement with the brand message and judge the effectiveness of your video messaging.
