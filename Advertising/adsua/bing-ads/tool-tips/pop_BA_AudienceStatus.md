# Association Status

**What it is:**  The status of the association between the ad group/campaign and audience, which indicates whether ads are eligible to display.

**What you need to know:**
- **Enabled**: The targeting association is enabled for this ad group/campaign.
- **Paused**: The ad group/campaign is paused from targeting/excluding users in the associated audience. However, this wonâ€™t prevent users from being added to the audience.
- **Excluded**: The exclusion association is active for this ad group/campaign. People included in the associated audience are excluded from the ad group/campaign.
