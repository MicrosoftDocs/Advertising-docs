# Product Extensions

**What it is:** Product Extensions are the link between your Product Ad campaign and your Microsoft Merchant Center store catalog.  Microsoft Advertising uses the Product Extension to include details from your catalog in your product ads.

**What you need to know:** Product Extensions can only be used with product ads, not text ads.

Product extensions are created at the campaign level. You can use a single Product Extension for multiple campaigns, but you cannot have a campaign linked to multiple Product Extensions.
