# Expected click-through rate

**What it is:**   The competitiveness of your keywords and ad copy in the marketplace for the same search queries.

**Why itâ€™s important:**   Ads that are relevant to searchers' queries or other input are more likely to have a higher click-through rate. This metric tells you if a keyword   is underperforming and causing a loss in impression share, so you can make keyword changes or remove ads altogether.

**What you need to know:**     When your report includes this attribute, be sure to also include the ad group item ID attribute to ensure the accuracy of your report.

When you download the report to a file, this column is called Keyword Relevance.
