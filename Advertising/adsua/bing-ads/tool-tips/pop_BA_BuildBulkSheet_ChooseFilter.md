# Filter spreadsheet data

**What it is:**  This is where you tell us exactly which data to query.

**How it works:**  Choose the entity and property you want to query, and then select the operand that determines how the entity property is queried (for example, Matches all, Contains, or Less than or equals).

If you add one or more rows of filters, the filters will be additive. This means that only data that meets all the filtersâ€™ criteria will be included in your spreadsheet.

**Example:**  If you filter on campaign names containing "holiday" and keywords containing "new year", your spreadsheet will only return data from "holiday" campaigns that also have at least one keyword containing "new year". It will not return data for a "new year" keyword that is not in a "holiday" campaign.

**Note:**  You will select what data actually appears in your spreadsheet in the next step.
