# Tax document

**What it is: **Nota Fiscal eletr√¥nica, or NFe, is a government issued document that verifies a business transaction for tax purposes. This document is mandatory for advertisers registered in Brazil.

**What you need to know: ** After you've submitted payment for charges due, an NFe document will become available in the Microsoft Advertising Billing grid within 48 hours. You'll see the following statuses.
- **NFe available: **Once the document is available, you'll see this status with a direct link to the PDF document.
- **NFe pending: ** You'll see this status before you've submitted payment, as well as within 48 hours of submitting a payment.
- **NFe failed: **If your account is missing a tax ID or full business address, you won't be able to get an NFe. Microsoft Advertising will generate one after you [update your tax information.](../hlp_BA_CONC_ISS.md)
- **NFe cancelled: **You'll see this status if your billing document is cancelled, because its the corresponding NFe will also be cancelled.
- **- (dash): **Not all billing documents will generate an NFe (such as credit memos). You'll see a dash instead.
