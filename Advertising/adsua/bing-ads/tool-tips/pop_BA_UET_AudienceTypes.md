**What it is:**     Audiences are groups of people who have something in common, like specific interests or online activity.

**What you need to know:**  The audience types you can create are:

- **Remarketing lists** : Lists you define of people who have visited or interacted with your website before. [Learn more about remarketing lists](../hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_Remarketing.md)
- **Dynamic remarketing lists** : Cultivated lists of people who have recently visited your website based on their interactions with your products or services. [Learn more about dynamic remarketing](../hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_ProductAudience.md)
