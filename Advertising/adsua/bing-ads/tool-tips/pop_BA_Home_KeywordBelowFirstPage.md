# Keywords below first-page bid

**What it shows:**  List of keywords that are active and can show. However, their current bid is below the system suggested first page bid. This means they are not getting the reasonable amount of first page impressions as they can.

**Why review it:**  Ads on the first page of Bing search result pages normally get more clicks. Keywords may sometimes get impressions and be on the first page, but the flag is indicating it can get more. To get bid suggestions that can move more of your ads to the first page, go to the Recommendations tab.
