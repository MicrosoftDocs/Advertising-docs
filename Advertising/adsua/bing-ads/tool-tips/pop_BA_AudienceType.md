# Type

**What it is** : There are several types of audiences:
- **Rule-based** : Remarketing lists for which you create list definitions (for example, based on page URLs).
- **Dynamic remarketing** : Remarketing lists for products, based on Microsoft Merchant Center feeds.
- **Similar to** : Lists generated automatically by Microsoft Advertising based on your existing remarketing lists.
- **Customer** : Lists of customer contact information that you have compiled to match with customers on the Microsoft Search Network or Microsoft Audience Network.
- **Combined** : A combination of multiple existing audiences into a new audience.

**Note** : Not everyone has all of these audience types yet.
