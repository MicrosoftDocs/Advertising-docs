# Budget type

**What it is** : This is the type of budget you selected when you created it.

**What you need to know:**  You can change your budget anytime. Your budget is the amount you want to spend per day. Standard daily budgets will be spent as evenly as appropriate throughout the day.

You can also apply a shared budget from the Shared Library. When you select one of the shared budgets you set up in the Shared Library, this campaign will draw from the same budget as the other campaigns using this shared budget. [Learn more about shared budgets](../hlp_BA_CONC_SharedBudgets.md)
