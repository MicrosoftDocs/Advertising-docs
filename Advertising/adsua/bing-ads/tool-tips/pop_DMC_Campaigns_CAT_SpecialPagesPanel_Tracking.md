# Tracking

**What it is:**  The pages listed here are the special pages you added for customer action tracking. When tracking is turned on, you can view detailed metrics for these pages on the **Customer action tracking** tile.

**What you need to know:**
- Microsoft Advertising tracks these pages for all your campaigns when tracking is turned on.
- You can pause tracking for any special page, which will pause tracking of the page for all campaigns. Note: You can still view the data we gathered prior to pausing tracking.
