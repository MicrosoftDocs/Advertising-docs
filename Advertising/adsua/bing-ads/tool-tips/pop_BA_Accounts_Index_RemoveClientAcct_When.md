# Stop managing account

You can choose to stop managing an account immediately or on a date of your choosing.

When you choose **Immediately**, this means that you’ll stop managing the account as soon as our system processes the request – usually in about 15 minutes.

When you choose a date in the future, you’ll stop managing the account on that date.
