# Conversions

**What it is: **       A conversion is a click that results in a sale or another measure of success. Conversions are measured by adding a small bit of code to your website pages so that a visitor’s        progress through your site can be tracked.

**Why it's important: **       Knowing how people interact with your website can give you valuable feedback on improving your website’s organization and content.
