# Age

**What it is**: With age targeting, you can specify the age range or ranges of the people you want your ads to appear for.

**Note**: As you add and edit targets, pay attention to the audience meter on the right side of the page. If your targeting becomes too narrow, you won't be able to save your campaign.
