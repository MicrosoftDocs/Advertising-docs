# Sold-to payment method

**What it is:**  This payment method belongs to the business that is advertising on Microsoft Advertising. If this payment method different from the primary payment method, then a bill-to customer (such as an agency) is in charge of payment. Otherwise, both payment methods are the same when a business manages its own advertising.

**What you need to know:**  Only the primary payment method is used to pay for account charges. The sold-to payment method conveys two important items: account ownership and business location. The SAP ID and business name distinguishes the sold-to customer if there's a different bill-to customer. Plus, the sold-to customer's business location determines taxation and currency options.
