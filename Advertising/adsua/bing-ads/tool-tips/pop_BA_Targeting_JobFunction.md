# Job function

**What it is** : With job function targeting, you can target your ads to be more (or less) likely to appear for people who most recently had specific kinds of jobs (according to their LinkedIn profiles).

**What you need to know** : Make a bid adjustment to increase or decrease the likelihood of your ad appearing for people who have specific kinds of jobs. You can increase each bid up to 900% or decrease it up to 90%.
