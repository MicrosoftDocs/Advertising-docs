# Opens to app store

**What it is:**     The number of times a user clicks on your ad and is directed to the app store to download your app.

**Why it's important:**     This number shows how many people donâ€™t have your app installed so you can judge how effective your ad is in attracting new customers and increasing downloads.

**Tips:**     When you add the app store URL and deep link URL numbers, you get the total clicks on your ad.
