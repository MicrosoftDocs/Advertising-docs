# Component type

**What it is:**     The component type (basic, deep link, favorite icon, form, image, titled link, or video) of the rich ad that was clicked. Rich ads in search (RAIS) are available on the search networks for branded or trademarked campaigns. This attribute is only available with the Rich ad component report.
