# Ad rotation

Ad rotation determines how often we deliver your active ads in relation to one another, when you have multiple ads in an ad group. You can select:

- **Optimize for clicks -**  Ads are prioritized which statistically are expected to perform well, based on auction characteristics such as keyword, search term, device, or location.
- **Rotate ads more evenly -**  Ad display is more balanced, and each ad has a similar chance of appearing. Note that ads with lower ad quality are prioritized less, and therefore might display less often, in lower positions, or not at all.

> The **Rotate ads more evenly** setting can allow lower-performing ads to appear as often as better-performing. The **Optimize** setting is recommended for most cases in which maximum performance is important.
