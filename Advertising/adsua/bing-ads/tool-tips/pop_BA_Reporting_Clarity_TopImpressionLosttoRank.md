# Top impression share lost to rank (%)

**What it is: **A percentage estimate of how often poor ad rank kept your ad from showing in the mainline, the top ad placements above the search results.

**Why itâ€™s important: ** Use this metric to help you assess why your ads are missing out on the best ad positions.

**What you need to know: ** Ad rank determines where your ad shows relative to other ads, based on factors including your bid amount, ad performance, ad relevance, ad extensions, other competing ads, and more.
