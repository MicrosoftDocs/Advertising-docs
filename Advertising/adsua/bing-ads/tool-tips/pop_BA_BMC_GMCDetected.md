# Product offer - Detected

**What it is:**  The number of offers uploaded or imported  that were identified by the system.

**What you need to know:**  The number of offers that were detected should match the number of offers you wanted to upload. If the numbers do not match, there was an issue where Microsoft Advertising couldn't identify all the offers you uploaded.
