# View-through conversions

**What it is** : View-through conversions are conversions that people make after they have seen your ad, even though they did not click the ad.

**What you need to know** : The conversions in this column only include conversions resulting from impressions in the Microsoft Audience Network (including both audience campaigns and search ads extended to the Microsoft Audience Network). By default, the values in the "All conv." column of your campaigns or conversion goals tables will include view-through conversions.
