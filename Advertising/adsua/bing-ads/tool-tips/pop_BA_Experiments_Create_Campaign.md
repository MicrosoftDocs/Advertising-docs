# Select search campaign

**What it is** : This is where you select the campaign you want to experiment on.

**What you need to know** : To ensure you are seeing a fair comparison, we strongly recommend not making any changes to a campaign's settings while you are running an experiment on it.

**Note** : Currently, only search campaigns are eligible for experiments.
