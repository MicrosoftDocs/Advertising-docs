# IF function syntax

**What it is** : This shows you how the IF function tag will appear in your title, path, or ad text field.

**What you need to know** : When your ad appears on a search results page and the IF function is met, the tag will be replaced by text. Such as:

- If device is mobile, then show "Free shipping on mobile orders".
- If customer is included in the selected audiences, then show "Save 30%".

You can set **Otherwise** default text that will show when the IF function is not met.
