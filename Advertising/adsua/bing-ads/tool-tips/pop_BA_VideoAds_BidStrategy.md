# Bid strategy

**What it is**: How you want to manage your bids.

**What you need to know**: You can choose from one of these bid strategy options:
- **Manual CPV**: You set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising uses these bids every time to optimize CPV (cost per view) for your videos. A view is counted when the video plays for two seconds or the person viewing clicks on the ad to visit your website.
- **Manual CPM**: You set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising uses these bids every time to optimize CPM (cost per thousand impressions) for your videos.
