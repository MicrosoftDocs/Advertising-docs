# Bid strategy

**What it is** : How you want to manage your bids.

**What you need to know** : You can choose from one of these bid strategy options:
- **Manual CPV** : You set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising uses these bids every time to optimize CPV (cost per view) for your videos. A view is counted when the video plays for two seconds or the person viewing clicks on the ad to visit your website.
- **Manual CPM** : You set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising uses these bids every time to optimize CPM (cost per thousand impressions) for your videos.
