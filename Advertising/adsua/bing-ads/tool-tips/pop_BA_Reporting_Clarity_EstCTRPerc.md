# Estimated CTR

**What it is:**     Estimated click-through rate, or the number of times an ad could be clicked by a particular age group or gender, divided by the number of times it could be served as an impression (expressed as a percentage)

**What you need to know:**  This value is an estimate because the age and gender is not known for the entire audience.
