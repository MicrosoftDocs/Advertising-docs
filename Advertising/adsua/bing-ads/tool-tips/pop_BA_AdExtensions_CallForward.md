# Call forwarding

Call forwarding is available in ad groups with at least 10 clicks and $10 spend in the last 30 days. We review the eligibility of your ad groups on a daily basis, so the number of eligible ad groups can change. Here are the call forwarding statuses:

**Provisioned:**  Your call forwarding number has been created and your ad group is eligible for call forwarding.

**Pending / ineligible:**  Your call forwarding number is in the process of being created, which usually takes about 24 hours, or your ad group does not yet meet the eligibility requirements.

**Not eligible:**  The ad group does not meet our guidelines for spend and click in the past 30 days.

**Not applicable:**  The ad group or campaign is not associated with a call extension that has call forwarding enabled.
