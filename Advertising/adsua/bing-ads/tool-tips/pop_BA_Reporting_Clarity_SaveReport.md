# Save as a custom report

**What it is:**     This allows you to save the report, including any changes you made to data columns, under **Custom reports** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, **Reports** > **Saved custom reports**) so you don't have to create it again.

**Why itâ€™s important:**     It allows you to run the same report in the future so you can compare the results.
