# Click type (ad extension reports)

**What it is:**     Each component that can be clicked in the ad—for example, the ad title, sitelink, phone number, or driving direction.

**Why it’s important:**     In the **Ad extension by keyword** and **Ad extension by ad** reports, you can see how many ad extension impressions you’re receiving and which click type is getting the most clicks and impressions.
