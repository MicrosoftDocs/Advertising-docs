# Last insertion order end date

**What it is: **    The end date for the last active insertion order.

**What you need to know: **

- [!INCLUDE [AccountsSummary_IO_Note1](../includes/AccountsSummary_IO_Note1.md)]
- If you have one active insertion order “end date” and “last end date” are the same.
- If you have more than one active insertion order, “last end date” is the date when you will no longer have an insertion order to cover your advertising charges.

**Example: **     You have insertion orders for every month of the year except April, the last IO end date will be March 31, because starting April 1, you will not have an insertion order to cover your advertising charges.
