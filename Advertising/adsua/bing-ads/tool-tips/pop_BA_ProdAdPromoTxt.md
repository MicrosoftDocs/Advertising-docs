# Promotional text

**What it is:**  Optional text that will be displayed below the price when a searcher hovers over your product ad. Promotional text will apply to all ads within the ad group.

**How to use:**  Use promotional text to draw more attention to your ads and highlight special features or promotions.

**Example:**  "Free shipping" and "15% all products" are examples of promotional text.

**What you need to know:**  If you don't add promotional text, you will see a default ad labeled "Product ad" listed on the Ads page. Don't delete this ad as it is needed by Microsoft Advertising in order for your Microsoft Shopping Campaigns to work correctly.
