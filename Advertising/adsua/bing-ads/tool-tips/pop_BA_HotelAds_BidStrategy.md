# Bid strategy

**What it is:**  How you want to manage your bids.

**What you need to know:**  Currently, there are two Hotel Ads bid strategy options:     
- **Fixed bid per night:**  Bid a flat rate for each night of the booking. Your total base bid is equal to the length of stay, multiplied by the flat rate.
- **Percentage of room price**  Bid based on a percentage of the booking room rate. Your total base bid is equal to the length of stay, multiplied by the room price, and by the percentage of the room price bid.

**Tip:**  You can set a subaccount's bid strategy and then subsequently set an individual hotel group's or hotel's bid strategy to a different option.
