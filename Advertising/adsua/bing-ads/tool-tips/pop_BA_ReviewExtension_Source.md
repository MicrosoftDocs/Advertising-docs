# Source

**What it is:** The third-party source from where your review is from.

**What you need to know:** The **Source** and **Source URL** must match. For example, a review from “Wine Club Reviews” must link to a page from that website, “www.wineclubreviews.com.” The combined character limit for the review text and review source is 67 characters.
