# Billing notifications

**What it is:**     You can choose to receive email notifications that have links to the following information:
- **For prepay accounts,**  you'll receive a notification for each account that has a link to your monthly statement.
- **For postpay threshold accounts,**  you'll receive a notification for each account that has a link to the Billing tab, where you will see a list of payments for the previous month. These payments will include payments made on your monthly billing date and payments made when you reach your billing threshold.

**What you need to know:**  If you choose to receive email notifications, you will get them for all of your prepay and postpay threshold accounts.
