# Mobile device preference

**What it is:** By selecting mobile as your device preference, you can create Sitelink Extensions specifically for customers using mobile devices.

**What you need to know:** Standard extensions will be given preference on computers or tablets. However, if your ad group contains mobile-optimized extensions only, those ads may appear on computers and tablets.
