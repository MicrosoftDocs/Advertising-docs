# Audiences to combine

**What it is**: Select the audiences you want to combine into a custom combination audience.

**What you need to know**: First, you'll select **how** you want to combine audiences:
- **OR**: This will include customers who are in any of these audience lists.
- **AND**: This will include only customers who are in every single one of these audience lists.
- **NOT**: This will **exclude** customers who are in any of these audience lists.

**Note**:
- Once you've made your selections and clicked **Done**, you'll have the option to add another combination. Multiple combinations are always combined with an AND function. This means that a customer must meet all of the criteria of each combination in order to appear in this combined list.
- You cannot have a combined list that uses only the NOT function. You should use audience exclusions instead.
