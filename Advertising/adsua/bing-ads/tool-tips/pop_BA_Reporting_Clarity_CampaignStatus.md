# Campaign status

**What it is:**     The status of the campaign—Active or Paused—when the report was run.

**Why it’s important:**     It helps you troubleshoot why ads might not be running.
**        What you need to know:**       When a campaign is deleted, the status of its respective ad groups, ads, and keywords may still show as paused or active. If you are unsure as to whether or not a campaign is deleted, please refer to the **Campaign status** column to officially confirm.
