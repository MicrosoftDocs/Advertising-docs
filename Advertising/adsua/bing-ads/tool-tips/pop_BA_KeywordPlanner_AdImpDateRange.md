# Date range

**What it is:**  You can enter a date range to see the average monthly searches for that time period.

**Note:**  Changing the date range will not affect the graphs shown for **Compare to market leader domains**, **Compare to competitor domains**, and **Ad impression share**. These graphs are always based on the previous monthâ€™s data.
