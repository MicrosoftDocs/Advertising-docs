# Domain validation

**What it is:**  To create a store, Microsoft Advertising must first validate your domain. You can validate it through a multi-step process in Bing Webmaster Tools. Or, if you have a Universal Event Tracking (UET) tag that's already associated to a domain,  Microsoft Advertising is able to use that UET tag for domain validation.
