# Import ad extensions

When we import your ad extension, we share the ad extension that are in more than one campaign. This means that later on, if you make a change to this ad extension, the change will affect all campaigns where you're using it.

If you choose not to share identical ad extensions between campaigns, we'll create a separate one for each campaign. It will look the same, but after import, you'll have to edit each ad extension separately.
