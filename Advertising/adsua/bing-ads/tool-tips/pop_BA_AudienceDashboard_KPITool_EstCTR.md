# Estimated monthly CTR (click-through rate)

**What it is**: The estimated number of times the ads in this ad group will be clicked divided by the number of times the ads will be shown (impressions) every month, given the above budget and bid settings.

**Why it's important**: CTR is a good way to quickly judge the effectiveness of your ad copy.

**Note**: This estimate is based on the budget and bid you set above, and is provided as a reference only. It is automatically generated by Microsoft Advertising and is not a guarantee of future performance. Your actual results may vary based on your targeting, budget, bid, and other settings.
