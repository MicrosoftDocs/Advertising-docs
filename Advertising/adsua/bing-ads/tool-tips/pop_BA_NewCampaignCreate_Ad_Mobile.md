# Mobile device preference

By selecting mobile device preference, you can create text ads specifically for customers using mobile devices,       for example an ad to sell a smartphone app or promote a lunch special. Whether your ad only shows on mobile devices depends on a number of things, including    your ad group device preferences and whether you have other ads in your ad group.
