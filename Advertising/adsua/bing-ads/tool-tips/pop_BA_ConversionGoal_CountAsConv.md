# Count as “conversions”

**What it is** : This setting determines whether or not these conversions will appear in the Conversions columns of your data tables.

**What you need to know** : If you uncheck Include in "Conversions" for a conversion goal, you can still track it using the "All conversions" columns of your Conversion goal data table and your reports. Also, if you use an automated bidding [bid strategy](../hlp_BA_CONC_BidStrategy.md), unchecking **Include in "Conversions"** will result in these conversions no longer factoring into automated bidding calculations.
