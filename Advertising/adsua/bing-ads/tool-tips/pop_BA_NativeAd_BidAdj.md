# Audience ads bid adjustment

**What it is:**        You can adjust your bids for Microsoft Audience Ads by specifying an audience ad bid adjustment at the campaign or ad group level. Audience ad bid adjustment works the same way as other bid adjustments for Microsoft Advertising campaigns, and is a percentage (%) increase or decrease on your ad group bids.

**What you should know:**  Audience ad bid adjustments can be  -100% to +900%. Applying an adjustment of -100% will opt-out the campaign or ad group from Microsoft Audience Ads.
