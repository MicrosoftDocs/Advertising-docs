# CTR (Exact match)

**What it is:**  The number of times an ad was clicked divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions) by an exact match. For example, if an advertiser's ad had 50 clicks out of 2,348 impressions, their CTR is 2.13%.

**Why it's important:**  CTR is a good way to quickly judge the effectiveness of an advertiser's ad copy.
