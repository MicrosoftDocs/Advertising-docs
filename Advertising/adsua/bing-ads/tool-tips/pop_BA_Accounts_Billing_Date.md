# When you pay

**What it is:**     Customers with postpay threshold accounts pay when they reach their monthly billing date or when they reach their billing threshold, whichever comes first.

**What you need to know:**

- Your monthly billing date is the monthly anniversary of the date that you signed up for Microsoft Advertising. This date cannot be changed.
- Billing threshold is set by Microsoft Advertising and increases over time as you make successful payments.

**Tip:**     If you want to set a limit on billing threshold, click **change threshold**.
