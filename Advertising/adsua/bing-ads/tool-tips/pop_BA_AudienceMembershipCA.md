# Membership duration

**How it works:**  When you create a custom audience, you can specify how far back in time Microsoft Advertising should look for actions that match your definition in order to add people to your list.

**How to choose:**   The membership duration is 30 days by default, but we recommend choosing a duration that works best for you based on your user buying cycle. The maximum duration allowed for Microsoft Advertising Search is 390 days.
