# Audience network impression share lost to rank (%)

**What it is:**     The percentage of impression share you lost due to low rank on the Microsoft Audience Network.

**What you need to know:**     Ad rank determines your ad position and whether your ad is able to show at all. It's calculated using your bid, quality, and the expected impact of ad formats.
