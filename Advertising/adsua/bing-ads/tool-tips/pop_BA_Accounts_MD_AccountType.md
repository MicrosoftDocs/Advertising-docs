# Account type

**What it is:**    The account type identifies whether an account is a manager account or an ad account, shown simply as Account. Those two accounts are related, similar to a child-parent relationship.

**What you need to know:**
- A manager account is a container for one Account or for multiple accounts.
- An Account is a singular account that directly serves ads. An ad account falls under a manager account.
