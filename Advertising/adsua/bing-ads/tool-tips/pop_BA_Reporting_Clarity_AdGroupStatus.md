# Ad group status

**What it is:**     The status of the ad group—Active or Paused—when the report was run.

**Why it’s important:**     It helps you troubleshoot why your ads aren't running.

**      What you need to know:**     When an ad group is deleted, its respective ads and keywords might still show as paused or active. If you are unsure as to whether or not an ad group is deleted, please refer to the **Ad group status** column to officially confirm.
