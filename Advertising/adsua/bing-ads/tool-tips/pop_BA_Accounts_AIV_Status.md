# Verification status

**What it is:** This describes the status of account identity verification, which can be:
- **Action required**: Action is required because the application for verification has been submitted and some additional requested information has not been received. You need to complete verification soon or your accounts will be paused, and we’ll stop showing your ads.
- **Failed**: The account is paused because we could not verify your identity. Please review your account information and submit a new application or appeal.
- **Not verified**: The account has not been verified. For example, an application for verification has not been submitted. You need to complete verification soon or your accounts will be paused, and we’ll stop showing your ads.
- **Pending**: The application for verification has been submitted and we're reviewing it. We'll send email with updates and requests for additional information as needed.
- **Verification not needed**: The advertiser account does not need verification or has not been selected for pilot.
- **Verified advertiser**: The advertiser account has been verified.
- **Verified limited**: You requested to verify as a business, but only your personal identity has been verified. Instead of the legal business name, your first and last name will be shown with ads. To complete business verification, you can contact support to review your business documents.
