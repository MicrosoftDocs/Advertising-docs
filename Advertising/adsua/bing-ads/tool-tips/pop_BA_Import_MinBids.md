# Bids and budgets

**      What it is:**     By selecting this option, Microsoft Advertising will increase all keyword, ad group, and auto-target bids to the minimum bid amount.

**      What you need to know:**     Your campaigns will still be imported if you donâ€™t select this option but any but any keywords, ad groups, and auto-targets that have a bid below the Microsoft Advertising minimum will not serve.
