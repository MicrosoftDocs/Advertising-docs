# Email notification

**What it is:**  This column tells you whether an email will be sent to you when the import happens.

**What you need to know:**  You set this option when you create the schedule and the choices are:

- No emails
- Send an email only if there are changes or errors
- Send an email only if there are errors
- Send an email every time this import runs
