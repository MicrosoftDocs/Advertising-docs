# Get keyword suggestions

**What it is:**        You can use this to get suggestions for keywords appropriate for your campaign.

**How it works:**

- Enter either a relevant word or your website's URL to see suggested keywords.
- For each suggested keyword, you'll see how many times people search on it every month, what its average cost per click (CPC) is, and how competitive this keyword is.
- Click the arrow next to a keyword suggestion to move the keyword over into the **Enter keywords** box.

**Note** : Keyword suggestions are currently supported for English-language campaigns that are targeted to locations within the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and/or Canada. If your campaign is global, then the suggestions are based on only these locations.
