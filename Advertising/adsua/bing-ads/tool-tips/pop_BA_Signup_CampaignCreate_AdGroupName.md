# Ad group name

**What it is: **       Enter a unique name for this ad group.

**What you need to know: **	   Campaigns are made up of one or more ad groups. Each ad group can be based on a theme of the campaign, and it's a good idea to have your ad group's name reflect its theme. For example, if your campaign's goal is to sell men's clothes, you might have ad groups such as "Dress shirts," "Coats and jackets," and "Spring sale."

**Note: **	   An ad group name cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.
