# Create accounts

For most people, one Microsoft Advertising account is all you'll ever need. However, if you want to give other users an account they can manage themselves, or if you need to keep billing separate for some of your campaigns, it might make sense to add new accounts.   Some things to know:

- You can use a different payment method for each account or use the same payment method for multiple accounts.
- You can use each payment method for a limited number of active accounts. Inactive accounts do not count toward this total.
