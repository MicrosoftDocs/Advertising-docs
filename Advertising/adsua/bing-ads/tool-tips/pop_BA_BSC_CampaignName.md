# Catalog

**What it is:** The name of the Microsoft Merchant Center store or data feed you uploaded that contains the offerings for this campaign.

**What you need to know:** Once you select a store or data feed for this campaign, you can't change it. If at some point you want to use a different data feed, you would need to create a new catalog campaign.

For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Merchant Center store](../hlp_BA_PROC_CreateBingMerchantCenterStore.md).
