# First level category

**What it is:**     Microsoft Advertising analyzes your website and categorizes its content. The first level category is the middle level—for example, if the top-level category is "shoes", first level categories might be "women's", "men's" or "children's".

**Why it’s important:**   Find out what gets customers to the parts of your website you want them to visit.
