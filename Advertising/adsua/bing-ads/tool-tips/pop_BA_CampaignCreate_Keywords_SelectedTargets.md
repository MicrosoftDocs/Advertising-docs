# Selected dynamic ad targets

**What it is:**  These are the webpages or categories of webpages you selected to target.

**What you need to know:**  You can now set a separate bid for each target. We will suggest bids for recommended categories, but you can edit each bid however you see fit.

**Note:**  If you leave the bid window empty, we will use your default ad group bid.
