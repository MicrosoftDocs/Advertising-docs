# Block aggregators

**What it is:**  Selecting this will block aggregators from serving any ads for the entire domain of your store. For example, if there are two stores (one for the United States and one for the United Kingdom) that use http://www.contoso.com and either one of them blocks aggregators, we will block aggregators for both stores.

**Why itâ€™s important:**  If you select this option, Microsoft Advertising will attempt to prevent aggregators from including your product offers.

**What you need to know:**  Aggregators consolidate product offers from multiple, often unrelated, businesses. By default, aggregators can include your catalog in their ads.
