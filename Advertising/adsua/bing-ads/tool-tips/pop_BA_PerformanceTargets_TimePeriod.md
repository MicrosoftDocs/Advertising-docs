# Time period

**What it is:**     When your performance target runs.

**What you need to know:** Performance targets can run for one of three time periods:
- Weekly starting Sunday
- Weekly starting Monday
- Monthly

Performance targets automatically renew themselves at the end of the time period you originally selected.
