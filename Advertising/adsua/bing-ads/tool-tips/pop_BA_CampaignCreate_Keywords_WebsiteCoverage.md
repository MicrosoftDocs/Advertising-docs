# Website coverage

**What it is**: This is the percentage of your website represented by pages that belong to each category.

**What you need to know**: A page can belong to multiple categories, so the total of this column may be higher than 100%.

**Note**: It can take up to 72 hours after you create a dynamic ad target for website coverage to update.
