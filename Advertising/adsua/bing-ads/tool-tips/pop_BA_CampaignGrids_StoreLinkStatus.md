# Status

**What it is:**  As a store linking request is created and then processed, it goes through different statuses:

**Pending**  means that a store owner has yet to approve or decline your linking request.

**Approved**  means that you now have access to the store and can start advertising products in that channel.

**Rejected**  means that a store owner declined your linking request.

**Expired**  means that a request was not approved by the expiration date, which is 30 days after a request is first sent.

**Cancelled**  means that the person requesting to link has cancelled the linking request.
