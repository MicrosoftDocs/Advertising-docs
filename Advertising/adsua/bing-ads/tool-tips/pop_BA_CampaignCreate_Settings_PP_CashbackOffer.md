# Maximum cashback offer (optional)

**What it is** : This is the maximum percent discount you want to offer potential customers.

**What you need to know** : Choose from one of these options to adjust the cashback offer for your campaign:

- Use the **Set to** option to set the maximum percent discount if you want to show your cashback offer to all customers within your campaign. Please note that if you enter a maximum cashback offer amount, then potential customers will only see cashback offers equal to or lower than that amount.
- If you choose to turn on Maximum cashback offers by selecting the **Set to** option and do not enter an amount, Microsoft Advertising will automatically decide the percent discount to show potential customers based on your campaign goals.
- Select **No cashback offer** if you only want to show your cashback offer to certain ad groups within your campaign. Then, you can adjust the **Maximum cashback offer** within your ad group settings.
