# Relative CTR (click-through rate)

**What it is: **    Your click-through rate divided by the average click-through rate of all ads that appear in the same sections of websites that show your ads.

**Why it's important: **    Relative CTR can help you understand campaign and ad group performance, particularly if you have little or no conversion information.
