# Ad status

**What it is:**     The status of the ad—Active, Paused, or Draft—when the report was run.

**Why it’s important:** It helps you troubleshoot why your ads might not be running.

**    What you need to know:**   Please note that when an ad is deleted, the status of its respective keywords may still show as paused or active.
