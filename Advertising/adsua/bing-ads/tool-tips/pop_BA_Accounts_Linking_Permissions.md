# Link permissions

**What it is:** Along with access, a direct manager needs a set of permissions to manage a linked account. Only standard access is available to those linking to an ad account. For manager accounts, there are two options: standard access or administrative access. Each permission set comes with a group of capabilities.

**Standard access for ad accounts**
- Add, delete, and manage campaigns
- Take over billing responsibilities as the bill-to customer
- Manage link requests to ad accounts

**Standard access for manager accounts**
- Add and delete ad accounts
- Add, delete, and manage campaigns
- Take over billing responsibilities as the bill-to customer
- Manage link requests to ad accounts

**Administrative access for manager accounts**
- Add and delete users
- Add and delete ad accounts
- Add, delete, and manage campaigns
- Take over billing responsibilities as the bill-to customer
- Manage link requests to both manager accounts and ad accounts
