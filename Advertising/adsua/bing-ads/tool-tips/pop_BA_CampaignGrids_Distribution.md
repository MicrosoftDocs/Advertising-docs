# Distribution preference

**What it is:** The network or networks your ad is set to appear on.

**What you need to know:** By default, all search ads are set to display across both the search network and the Microsoft Audience Network. If you selected **Audience ads preferred format** when you created an ad, it will be distributed only on the Microsoft Audience Network.
