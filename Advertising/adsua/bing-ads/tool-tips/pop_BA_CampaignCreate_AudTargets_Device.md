# Device

**What it is** : With device targeting, you can specify the type of device your ads will appear on: **Desktop** (includes laptops), **Tablet**, and/or **Smartphone**.

**Note** : As you add and edit targets, pay attention to the audience meter on the right side of the page. If your targeting becomes too narrow, you won't be able to save your campaign.
