# Description

**What it is:** Two lines of optional descriptive text that can appear under Sitelink Extensions. These enhanced Sitelink Extensions can help draw attention to your ad by increasing its size.

**What you need to know:** Only high-quality ads at the top of the search results page will trigger enhanced Sitelink Extensions, so make sure you add descriptions to high-performing campaigns.

**Tip:** If you add a description, you must add text to both lines. Your text link will be limited to 25 characters, instead of 35. If you don't have descriptive text for your Sitelink Extension, the link text can contain up to 35 characters.
