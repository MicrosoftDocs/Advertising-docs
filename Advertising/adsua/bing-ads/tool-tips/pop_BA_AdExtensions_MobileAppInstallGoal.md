# Mobile app install goal

**What it is:** A tag-less goal that is created to track installs and clicks for your mobile app.

**What you need to know:** You can track app installs and clicks for your apps by creating a goal. App install tracking goals are tag-less, which means that you donâ€™t have to add the code to your website to track and measure user activity. Keep in mind that you need to sign up with a Microsoft Advertising-certified partner and get the app-specific measurement URL and SDK to track app extension installs as conversions.
