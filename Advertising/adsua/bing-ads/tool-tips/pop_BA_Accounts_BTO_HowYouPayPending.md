# Payment setting

**What it is:**  The payment setting determines advertising charges are paid in advance (prepay) or paid after charges have accrued (postpay threshold or monthly invoice).

**What you need to know:**

- For a **prepay account** , the account will need to have funds up front so that it will be active. If there is a balance, we will refund it to the current bill-to customer when the billing responsibilities change.
- You can [learn how to apply for monthly invoice here](../hlp_BA_PROC_MonthlyInvoiceApply.md).
