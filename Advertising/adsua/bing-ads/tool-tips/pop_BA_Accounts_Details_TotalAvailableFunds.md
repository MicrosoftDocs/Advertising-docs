# Total available funds

**What it is:** This is the amount of money that you can effectively spend on advertising.

**What you need to know:** This section contains two figures: Account balance and Prepay total balance.
- **Account balance** is the prepay amount you directly added to your account (minus taxes in locales where online advertising is taxable).
- **Prepay total balance** is the combination of your account balance plus any credits and promotional balances.
- Click costs, applicable taxes, and adjustments will be deducted from your available funds.
