# Invite an agency to manage your account

Within Microsoft Advertising, you can set up a relationship with an agency by inviting it to manage your Microsoft Advertising account. By doing so, you are allowing the agency access to and control over your Microsoft Advertising campaigns and budget.

This client-agency relationship within Microsoft Advertising does not affect your billing relationship with Microsoft Advertising. You cannot set a commission or fee structure within Microsoft Advertising, and agency fees must be billed and paid outside of Microsoft Advertising. Any agreement between the agency and client regarding fees or commissions does not involve Microsoft, and Microsoft will not mediate any disputes.

Before you invite an agency, you will need to obtain the following information:

- The agency's Microsoft Advertising manager account number.
- The email address of someone at the agency who is an Microsoft Advertising administrator for the agency.

After you have the required information, click **Invite agency**. Fill out and send the invitation. After the agency accepts the invitation, you will see them listed on this tab as one of your agencies.
