# People currently in your targeted locations

**What it is:**      By selecting this option, your ads will appear for people who are physically in your targeted locations.

**Example:**      You are a plumber in Toronto and only want to advertise to people who might use your service.

**Note:**      You can select both options to have your ads appear to people in, searching for, or viewing pages about your targeted locations.
