# Standard budget

**What it is:**         This setting determines how your budget is spent over the course of the day.

**What you need to know:**        With standard budget, you'll spend roughly the same amount every day so that you donâ€™t run out of budget early in the month. Your daily standard budget is based on an estimated monthly budget (your daily standard budget x number of days in the month). Variations in your daily budget will occur; however, you will not exceed the estimated monthly budget.
