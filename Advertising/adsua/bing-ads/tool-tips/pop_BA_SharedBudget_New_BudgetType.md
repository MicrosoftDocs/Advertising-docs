# Standard vs. Accelerated budget types

**What it is:**         This setting determines how your budget is spent over the course of the day.

**What you need to know:**        For most customers, we recommend a standard budget. Here’s the difference:
- **Standard:** Spend roughly the same amount every day so that you don’t run out of budget early in the month. Your daily standard budget is based on an estimated monthly budget (your daily standard budget x number of days in the month). Variations in your daily budget will occur; however, you will not exceed the estimated monthly budget.
- **Accelerated:** Spend at an accelerated rate, which means that we will show your ad for every relevant search until you run out of budget for the day. Accelerated budgets are not recommended for most advertisers.
