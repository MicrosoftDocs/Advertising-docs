# Prepay balance

**What it is:**     Prepay balance is the amount of funds remaining in this prepay account.

**What you need to know:**
- There can be a delay of up to 4 hours between the time someone clicks your ad and the time the charge appears in this column.
- Filtering the table does not affect the amount shown here.
- Click costs, taxes, and adjustments can affect the prepay balance.

**Tip:** Keep your ads running! Set up auto-recharge to prevent your prepay balance from hitting zero. [Learn more](../hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md)
