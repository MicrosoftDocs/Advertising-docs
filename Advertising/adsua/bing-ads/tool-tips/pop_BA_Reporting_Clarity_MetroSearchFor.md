# Metro area (searching for)

**What it is:**     The name of a metro area if the user’s geographical intent can be determined. The metro area is set if the user’s intent is a metro area or city within the metro area, and not necessarily if they are physically located in the metro area.

**Why it’s important:**     This helps you find out how your ads are doing in different locations, which can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.
