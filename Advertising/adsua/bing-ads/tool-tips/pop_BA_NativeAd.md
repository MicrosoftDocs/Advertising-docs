# Microsoft Audience Ads

**What it is**: Microsoft Audience Ads is a native advertising solution optimized for search advertisers. This feature enables advertisers to get additional high-quality traffic from non-search placements. Microsoft Audience Ads experiences, such as ads placed within articles, are engaging for users, integrate naturally into page content, and deliver visually rich ads for advertisers. Microsoft Audience Ads campaigns are easy to set up, maintain, and optimize because they are fully integrated with existing Microsoft Advertising workflows.

**What you need to know**: Microsoft Audience Ads appear on the Microsoft Audience Network. These ad placements are cross-device and include premium sites like MSN, Outlook.com, Microsoft Edge, and other partners (with more to come). Clicks on these ads will take users to the landing page you specified when you created your ads.
