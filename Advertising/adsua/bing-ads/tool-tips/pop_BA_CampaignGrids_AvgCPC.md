# Average cost-per-click (CPC)

**What it is:**        The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks during this period.        This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of $48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is $0.16.

**What it isn't:**        Average CPC is not the same as current bid (max CPC). Current bid is the maximum cost-per-click that you are willing to pay (not including your bid adjustments).
