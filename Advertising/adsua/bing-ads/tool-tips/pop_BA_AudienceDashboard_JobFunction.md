# Job function

**What it is**: With job function targeting, you can target your ads to be more (or less) likely to appear for people who most recently had specific kinds of jobs (according to their LinkedIn profiles).

**Note**: As you add and edit targets, pay attention to the audience meter on the right side of the page. If your targeting becomes too narrow, you won't be able to save your campaign.
