# Custom parameter

**What it is:**   A tag you define that you can add to your tracking template. When someone clicks your ad, the URL can include information about that ad, including the value of the tag.

**What you need to know:**   Enter the name of this tag and the value that will be recorded, like the specific ad that was shown, or the keyword that triggered the ad.
