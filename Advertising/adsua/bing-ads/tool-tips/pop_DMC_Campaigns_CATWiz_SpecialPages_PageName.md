# Special page name

**What it is:**  A name that will help you remember which page you added. The page name will display on the **Customer action tracking** metrics tile.

**What you need to know:**
- Each page name has to be unique. If you have more than one page of the same type, such as multiple product pages, customizing the page name can help you identify each page when you're viewing metrics in Microsoft Advertising.
- You can view detailed metrics for these pages on the **Customer action tracking** tile. From the **Ads** page, click a campaign. The **Customer action tracking** metrics tile displays for that campaign.
