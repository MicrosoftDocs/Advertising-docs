# Website exclusions

**What it is** : To prevent your ads from appearing on certain websites, just enter the website URL here. For example, you can type: contoso.com www.contoso.com autos.contoso.com contoso.com/widgets http://www.contoso.com https://www.contoso.com

**Tip** : If you want to block all traffic from a specific domain, leave off the "www" prefix. For example, use "contoso.com" if you want to block traffic from www.contoso.com and www2.contoso.com.

**Note** : You can't add Microsoft sites (such as microsoft.com) to your excluded websites list.
