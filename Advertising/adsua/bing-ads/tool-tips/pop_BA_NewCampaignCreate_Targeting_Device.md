# Targeting by device

**What it is** : Your ads will display on every device type by default but you can make bid adjustments to target by desktop computer (which also includes laptop computers), tablet, or smartphone. A bid adjustment is a percentage increase to your keyword bid to improve the chance that your ad will display to people searching on a specific device type. For example, if you are targeting customers who are on the move, you can increase your bid by 50% for smartphones.
