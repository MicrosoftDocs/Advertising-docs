# Which option is best for me?

**Use an existing email address**  if:
- You've never used Microsoft Advertising and want to sign in using an existing work, school, or personal email address from a service such as Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo.
- You already sign in to Microsoft Advertising with an email address and you want to add an additional manager account (which is typically done by ad agencies that manage clients).

**Create a new email address**  if you do not want to use or do not have an existing email address.

> [!NOTE]
> A best practice for companies or agencies that have multiple employees using a Microsoft Advertising account is to have each person sign in with a separate email address. Having separate user accounts is [more secure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=528347) and also has the benefit of letting you use [change history](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=529956) to review changes made per user.
