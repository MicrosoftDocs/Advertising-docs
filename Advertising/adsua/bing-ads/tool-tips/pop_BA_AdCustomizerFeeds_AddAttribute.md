# Add custom attribute

**What it is** : Custom attributes are specific categories of text or numerical values that you define.

**Why it's important** : The pieces of text or numerical values you include for each attribute will be automatically inserted into your ads based on what individual customers are searching for or the content of the webpage theyâ€™re looking at.

**What you need to know** : The types of attributes you can define are:
- **Text** : Any letters, numbers, or symbols. For example, if you sold shoes, you could have an attribute named "Shoe Name" that would include "Contoso 100", "Contoso 200", "Contoso 300", etc.
- **Number** : Any whole number. For example, you could have an attribute named "Inventory Count" that would list the number of each product still available.
- **Price** : Any number (including decimals) and valid currency characters. For example, you could have an attribute named "Cost" that would list the price of each product.
- **Date** : Date and time formatted as in yyyy/MM/dd hh:mm:ss. For example, you could have an attribute named "Sale End" that would have a different date for each product.

**Note** : You cannot give a custom attribute the same name as any standard attribute: ```Device preference```, ```Scheduling```, ```Start date```, ```End date```, or ```Custom ID```.
