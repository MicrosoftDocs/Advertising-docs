# Negative keywords in list

**What it is: **       The negative keywords in this list are words and phrases that you don’t want to trigger your ad. For example, if you sell fine chocolates, you might want to add the popular dog breed “chocolate Labrador” as a negative keyword.

**Why it's important: **       By filtering out impressions shown to people who won’t be interested in your ad, you can increase your click-through rate.

**What you need to know: **       You can share this list with multiple campaigns.
