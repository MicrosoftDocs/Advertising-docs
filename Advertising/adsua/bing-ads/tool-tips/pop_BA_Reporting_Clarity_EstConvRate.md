# Estimated conversion rate

**What it is:**     The estimated number of conversions that result in a sale or another measure of success to a particular age group or gender, divided by the estimated number of clicks by that age group or gender.

**What you need to know:**     This value is an estimate because age and gender are not known for the entire audience.
