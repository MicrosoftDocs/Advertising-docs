# Deleted items total

**What it is** : This is the portion of your ad performance that either belonged to an item that you have deleted or was recorded using a keyword match type that you subsequently changed.

**What you need to know** :  You cannot restore deleted items, but you can go to the Change History tab to review recently deleted items.
