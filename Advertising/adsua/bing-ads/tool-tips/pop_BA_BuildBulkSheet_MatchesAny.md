# Matches any

**What you need to know:**  "Matches any" operands will return data that matches any of your search parameters.

**Example:**  If you filter on campaign names containing "holiday" and starting with "sale", your spreadsheet will return data from campaign names that contain "holiday" and from campaign names that start with "sale".

**Note:**  If you are querying your search parameters in the same way (for example, Contains, Equals, or Starts with), you can hit Enter to input multiple parameters in the same field.
