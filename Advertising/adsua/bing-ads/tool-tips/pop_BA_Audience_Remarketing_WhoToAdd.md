# Whom to add to your list

**What it is:**  The rules that define who you want to add to this remarketing list based on the section of your website that they visited.

**What you need to know:**  We offer four types of rules so you can target different groups of people.

**Example:**  You can create a shopping cart abandoners remarketing list by selecting **Visitors of a page who didn't visit another page** and define:

- Visitors of the cart.html page
- Who didn’t visit confirmation.html page
