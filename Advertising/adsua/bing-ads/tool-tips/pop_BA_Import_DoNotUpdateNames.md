# Do not update existing campaign names

**      What it is:** When enabled, this option will not change your existing Google Ads campaign names during this import. However, settings and items linked to those campaigns will still be updated. Existing campaigns will be updated if the original items were created by an import after March 21, 2016. Otherwise, new campaign names will be created.

**        What you need to know:**       This is only applicable for existing campaigns and will not affect new campaigns.
