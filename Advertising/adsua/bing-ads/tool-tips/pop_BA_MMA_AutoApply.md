# Auto-apply Multimedia Ads

**What it is:**     Microsoft Advertising can automatically apply suggested Multimedia Ads to your account.

**What you need to know:**         If auto-apply is enabled, youâ€™ll have seven days to accept or decline the suggested ads. After the review period, the Multimedia Ads will be automatically applied to your account. Without auto-apply we may still generate Multimedia Ads for you to review, but they will not be automatically applied.
