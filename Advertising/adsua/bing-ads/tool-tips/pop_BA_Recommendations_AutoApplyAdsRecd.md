# Auto-apply ad recommendations

**What it is:**  Enable these options to allow Microsoft Advertising to automatically apply ad recommendations meant to help you boost ad performance.

**What you need to know:** We’ll let you know when suggested ads are ready for you to review. You can find ad recommendations on the **Recommendations** page. If you don’t take action, we’ll automatically apply them after the review period:

- Multimedia ads: 7 days
- All others: 14 days

You can change your auto-apply options at any time. If you don’t choose to auto-apply ad recommendations, you’ll still be able to apply recommendations manually.

**Why it's important:**  Ad groups with three or more quality ads tend to perform better than those with one or none. Automated ads are created for ad groups that show potential for better performance.
