# Product Targets

**What it is:** A Product Target tells Microsoft Advertising what products you want to trigger your Product Ad. You can select all products in your catalog or narrow it down by brand, SKU, or other characteristics.

**Why it’s important:** Your Product Targets are essentially your keywords for your product ads. Just like keywords for text ads, Product Targets are compared to a customer’s search query or other input and potentially trigger an ad.

**What you need to know:** Unlike keywords, where you can choose any word to add to your list, you choose Product Targets from your Bing Merchant  catalog. You can choose **All products** or choose **Filtered products** to include only products with specific attributes, such as brand or SKU.
