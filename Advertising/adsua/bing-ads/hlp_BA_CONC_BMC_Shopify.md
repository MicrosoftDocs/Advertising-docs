Microsoft Advertising and Shopify are partnering up to create a Microsoft Advertising  app for Shopify. Shopify is a multi-channel commerce platform that allows you to create and develop an online store, where you can sell, ship, and manage your products. With the Microsoft Advertising app on Shopify, you can now bring your Shopify product catalog online to Microsoft Merchant Center, where you can set up shopping campaigns to promote your products.

## Getting started
You can get started in four steps. Before you start, however, be sure to have a Microsoft account ready to go and have the Microsoft Advertising  app for Shopify installed.

**Installing and configuring the Microsoft Advertising  app for Shopify**
Go to the [Install an app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2109447) and follow the prompts to get your Microsoft Advertising  app for Shopify set up.

To configure the Microsoft Advertising  app for Shopify, you'll need to set up the following:
- Store name customization							 When setting up your Microsoft Merchant Center, you can configure your store's name. This is important: Once you configure your store's name, you cannot change it.
- Target country
- Contact details: Language and e-mail address

> [!NOTE]
> Do you have a Microsoft account? If not, [create a new Microsoft account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398340).

Here's a look at the four steps you need to take to get started with Shopify.

1. **Create or connect to a Microsoft Advertising account**
If you’re new to Microsoft Advertising, all you need is your Microsoft account and a few details about your business to sign up through the app. You'll be taken to the Microsoft Advertising sign up page, where you'll create your Microsoft Advertising account and set up your billing and payment information. Once that’s complete, you’ll need to come back to Shopify and connect your accounts. Then, you’ll need to enter a few details to set up your Microsoft Merchant Center account within the app.

1.  						**Get more info**

   - [About app permissions in Shopify](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2099640)

1. **Select the Microsoft Advertising account**
After you've connected your Microsoft account in Shopify, select the Microsoft Advertising account you want to use.

**Do I need to set up a Microsoft Merchant Center account?**
- **New  Microsoft Advertising accounts**								 										If you created a new Microsoft Advertising account from the Microsoft Advertising app on Shopify, you’ll need to create a new Microsoft Merchant Center as well. This is required before you can complete your account setup and begin creating shopping campaigns from within the Microsoft Advertising app on Shopify. 								 								 										Be sure to review all options for creating your in the Microsoft merchant account creation form and save to confirm the settings to proceed to the next step.
- **Existing Microsoft Advertising accounts**								 										If you have an existing Microsoft Advertising account within the Microsoft Advertising app on Shopify, you’ll still need to complete the Microsoft Merchant Center form within the app before you can complete your account setup and begin creating shopping campaigns. 								 								 										Review all options in the Microsoft merchant account creation form and save to confirm the settings to complete creating your Microsoft Merchant Center. Once you click save, Microsoft will attempt to match the Shopify store URL to any existing stores in your Microsoft Advertising account. If the URL matches an existing Microsoft Merchant Center store, it will be associated with your Microsoft Advertising app on Shopify. If there is no matching URL, a new Microsoft Merchant Center store will be created for you.

1. **Set up your Microsoft Merchant Center account**
Enter the target country and contact details to get started with your Microsoft Merchant Center.

1. **Create a Microsoft Smart Shopping Activity**
From the **Marketing** page in Shopify, select **Create a campaign** >  **Build your campaign by adding a marketing activity** > **Microsoft Advertising Shopping Campaign (recommended)**. Enter the activity details with daily budget (minimum recommended: $30 USD) and then select **Publish activity**.

   - A marketing activity is equivalent to a campaign within Microsoft Advertising and in many cases the terms are used interchangeably.
   - [Smart shopping campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_BSC_SmartShopping.md) automate bids and ad delivery to personalize the shopping experience for customers who are more likely to convert at higher revenue values.
   - Do not select the **Microsoft Bid Strategy Campaign (Sunsetting)** activity option. This bid strategy option will soon be removed.

## Coupon redemption

## Reporting
Get insight into how your shopping campaigns created through Shopify are performing from the [Marketing page in Shopify](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2109449). You can view reports that track data like impressions, clicks, and conversions, where you can use the information to improve your campaign’s relevance. 					 					 				You can access the reports by going to the Marketing page from your Shopify admin account or through Microsoft Advertising.
> [!NOTE]
> There can be up to a 48-hour delay for impressions and clicks data seen in Microsoft Advertising to appear in your Shopify admin account.

## UET for Shopify
Universal Event Tracking (UET) is the key that unlocks powerful Microsoft Advertising features such as conversion tracking, audience targeting, and automated bidding bid strategies. The key comes in the form of the UET tag, which records what customers do on your website and sends that information to Microsoft Advertising. UET is a prerequisite for conversion tracking, remarketing in paid search, and automated bidding bid strategies.  Learn more about [UET](./hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2WhatIsTag.md).

By downloading the Microsoft Advertising app for Shopify, your UET tag is automatically created and the tag is added to every page of your website. There's nothing more for you to do!
