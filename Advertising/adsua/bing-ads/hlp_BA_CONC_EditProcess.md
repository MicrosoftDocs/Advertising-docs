# The editorial review

All components of your ads—ad text, keywords, ad extensions, and ad customizers—must pass an editorial review. This is a quality check to help ensure that ads are appropriate for potential customers. After you submit a component, the content goes through an initial review to ensure that it meets [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md). If your ad components don't raise any flags, they pass the review and become active.

If a component does not pass the initial review, an additional review takes place, which can take several hours based on the volume of reviews moving through the system at any given time. Several situations might trigger an additional review, including:

- A word might have a double meaning that could be interpreted as offensive in a certain context.
- The content might include terms that are registered trademarks, which require review for appropriate use.
- A keyword is not in the editorial database.

Most reviews are completed within a day. The editorial status of your ad components can be found in the **Delivery** column of the **Ads**, **Keywords**, or **Ad Extensions** table, or in  **Shared Library**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; **Business data** (or **Tools** &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; **Business data**). If the review results in a disapproved ad or keyword, see [How do I fix a Disapproved or Approved Limited status?](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialDisapprovalReasons.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For ads to pass the review process, they must be written in the same language as the ad group language and market setting.
> Editorial checks do not stop once an ad is live. The Microsoft Advertising team performs ongoing reviews to help ensure a quality marketplace. For this reason, ads and keywords that have previously displayed may be disapproved.
> Ads, keywords, ad extensions, and ad customizers will not go through another editorial review if only the protocol of a URL was changed ("http://" to "https://", or vice versa).
