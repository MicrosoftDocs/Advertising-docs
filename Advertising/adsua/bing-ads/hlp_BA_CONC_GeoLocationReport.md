# See where ad traffic comes from with the Geographic report

Once you set a campaign to [target by geographic location](./hlp_BA_PROC_TargetingAgeGender.md), use the Geographic report  to find out how your ads are doing in different locations. This information can help you decide where to focus more of your advertising efforts.

Two columns in this report give you details about the geographic location:

- **Location type:** Shows the location used to serve your ad, either the customers' physical location or where they were looking (their location of interest).
- **Most specific location:** Shows the most specific location that was used for targeting, giving you a more detailed view of where your ads are being displayed.       Based on system and data limitations, Microsoft Advertising can't always receive the most granular location. For example, this column could list a city, a state or an entire country.

## How to read the report

Let’s say you sell products only in Seattle, and you’re using the default targeting option    for your campaign (“People in, searching for, or showing interest in your targeted location”). Your Geographic report shows    that 100 ad clicks have a “Physical location” location type and 80 ad clicks have a “Location of interest” location type.

Based on this data, you conclude that along with many local searchers (searching their "physical location"), a significant number of people from outside Seattle are searching for a business like yours in Seattle (the "location of interest"). So, you might expand    your location targeting to a larger radius, including other cities in the region, to reach out to potentially more interested people.

Along with clicks, you can compare the estimated impressions, impression rate (%), click-through rate (%), conversions, and conversion rate (%)   to get a better idea of how your ad is performing in each location.
