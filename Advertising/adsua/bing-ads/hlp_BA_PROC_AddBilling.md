# Paying by credit and debit card

A credit card is the most widely accepted form of payment in Microsoft Advertising. We also accept debit cards and prepaid cards with some restrictions. For the complete list of payment methods available in your country/region, please see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md)

**Don't forget:** Adding a payment method is just one step to getting your ads up and running. For postpay threshold accounts, you'll need to designate a primary payment method as described below. For prepay accounts, you'll need to [add funds](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md).

## Adding a credit/debit card for the first time
When you first sign up for Microsoft Advertising, we guide you through account setup, where you're asked to [choose a payment setting](./hlp_BA_CONC_HowBillingWorks.md) and to add a payment method. If you skipped these steps, you can add a credit card in the Payment Methods page, which is essentially your wallet in Microsoft Advertising.

Please note: If you've never added a payment method before, we'll set the first card you add as your primary payment method.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectAccount_VR](./includes/SelectAccount_VR.md)]
1. Select **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Select **Add card**.
1. From the list, select the country/region of your card's billing address. (If your business location is in Brazil or India, your billing country/region is set by default and cannot be changed.)
1. Choose your **Payment setting**, if you haven't already.
1. Then, enter your card details: the **Card number**, the **Expiration date**, the **Security code**, the **Name on card**, and the **Billing address**.
1. Select **Save** when you're done.

## Setting up a backup card or replacing your primary card for one account
Don't let payment issues interrupt your campaigns. Add a backup card to make sure your charges are paid in case there are problems with your primary card (like when you've reached your card limit or your card expired). Or, you can simply switch to a new primary card by following the instructions below.

Keep in mind: Backup cards can only be used with a postpay threshold account.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectAccount_VR](./includes/SelectAccount_VR.md)]
1. Select **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Select **Add card**.
1. From the list, select the country/region of your card's billing address. (If your business location is in Brazil or India, your billing country/region is set by default and cannot be changed.)
1. Select whether you want to set the additional card as a primary payment method (to replace the existing card), a backup payment method, or to just add it to the list an available payment methods.
1. Then, enter your card details: the **Card number**, the **Expiration date**, the **Security code**, the **Name on card**, and the **Billing address**.
1. Select **Save** when you're done.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have several payment methods in your wallet, you can easily switch primary and backup payment methods. Just go to the Payment Methods page, select an account if you have more than one, and then click “set as primary” and “set as backup” next to the payment method you want to set as your primary and backup.

## Replacing the primary card for multiple accounts
You can use the same card to pay for up to 20 accounts.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Select **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Select **set as primary** next to the card you want to use as your primary payment method.
1. We'll show you the list of accounts where your selected card is already used as the primary payment method, if any. To designate the card as the primary for several accounts, choose **Select All** or select the individual accounts in **Add as primary payment method to other Microsoft Advertising accounts**.

## Editing your card details (including expiration date)
1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Select **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Select **edit** next to the card you want to update.
1. You can edit the **Expiration date**, the **Name on card**, and the **Billing address**.
1. Select **Save** when you're done.

## Deleting a card
You can delete a credit/debit card as long as it is not set as the primary payment method for an account. If it is being used by an active account, you need to set a different card or payment method to the account before you can delete it.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectAccount_VR](./includes/SelectAccount_VR.md)]
1. Select **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. In the list of payment methods, locate the payment method you want to delete and select **Delete**.
1. When the confirmation message appears, click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Microsoft Advertising to maintain financial records for tax reporting purposes. You can delete credit or debit card information so that it is no longer displayed in Microsoft Advertising. However, doing so does not remove the credit or debit card information from the Microsoft Advertising database.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> Only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)
> Your bank might require multi-factor authentication to help prevent online fraud and unauthorized access to your account. Learn more about [Payment Services Directive 2 and Strong Customer Authentication](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2104266).
> If we need to verify your card, we'll make a small authorization charge (for example, $1 USD). The authorization charge will be removed from the account in a few days, and you will not be required to pay it.
> Prepaid cards can only be used to fund prepay accounts, except in India.
> For advertisers in Brazil: Your account currency can only be set to Brazilian real. Your card must also be denominated in Brazilian real and have a billing address in Brazil.
> For advertisers in India: Microsoft Advertising does not accept debit cards in India. Your account currency can only be set to Indian rupee. Your card must also be denominated in Indian rupee and have a billing address in India.
> If you have trouble adding a card, see [I'm having trouble adding a credit card or debit card](./hlp_BA_CONC_TshootCreditCards.md).
