# Best practices for audience ad images

Here are some things to keep in mind when considering images for your audience ads:

## Choose the right imagery

- Make sure you're uploading high-quality images to make your ad stand out.
- Pick lifestyle images (photos of people living life to the fullest) that your target audience can relate to. Don't just use a graphic of your logo or a picture of your product—the more widely applicable the image is, the better.
- Choose images that align with your brand.
- Images with text overlays are not allowed.

## Upload multiple images

- The more images and the more ad variations, the better!
- Rotate your images regularly. Experiment with your images and ad copy to keep your ads fresh and see what performs best.

## Image specifications

> [!NOTE]
> If you advertise on the Google Display Network, Facebook Audience Network, or Yahoo Gemini, you can use the same creative assets for your Microsoft Advertising campaigns.

- Accepted file types for images: .jpeg, .png
- Images with text overlays are not allowed.
- High-resolution images only—they should not pixelate or degrade across screens.
- There are no maximum dimensions or file size for images for responsive ads.
- Images must be relevant to the ad and landing page. We recommend that you include the same imagery on the ad's landing page to ensure relevance.
- Before submitting images, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats.
- Note that your images may be cropped or used with headline overlays in their ultimate ad placement.
- Images must conform to [Microsoft Advertising policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341).
