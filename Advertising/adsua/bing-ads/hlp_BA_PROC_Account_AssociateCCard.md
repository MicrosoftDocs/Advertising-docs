# How to change payment methods

You can use a different credit card, debit card, or other payment method to pay your account charges at any time.

[!INCLUDE [Redesign](./includes/Redesign.md)]
1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Click **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectAccount_VR](./includes/SelectAccount_VR.md)]
1. If the payment method you want to use isn't listed under **Available payment methods**, click the **Add** button for the type of payment method you want to add. Be sure to add all the required info and then click **Create**.
1. Next to the payment method you want to use, click **set as primary**.
1. In the confirmation message, click **OK**.

If you have any existing charges on your postpay threshold account, the charges will be billed to the new payment method     at your next billing cycle. For a prepay account, you can add funds as soon as you've switched to the new payment method.    However, if auto-recharge was set up for your previous payment method, you will need to set it up again for your new payment method.     See [Add funds to a prepay account](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md) for more information.

For a list of payment methods that you can use based on your account country, currency, and payment setting (prepay or postpay),  see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Standard Users can set existing payment methods as primary or backup. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)
