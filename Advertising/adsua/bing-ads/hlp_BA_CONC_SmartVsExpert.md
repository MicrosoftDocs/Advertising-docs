# Smart campaigns: Is switching to Expert Mode right for you?

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

When you first [get started with smart campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Intro.md) in Microsoft Advertising, you're in Smart Mode. Smart Mode is a streamlined, simple experience that lets Microsoft Advertising's AI take care of most of the nuts and bolts of ad campaign management. It's a great way for small businesses and novice advertisers to start off advertising on the Microsoft Search Network.

Expert Mode is the full-featured Microsoft Advertising experience. It gives you more control over campaign management, lets you add more content to your ads, and provides much more in the way of performance reporting and tracking.

People starting out in Microsoft Advertising can take three different paths:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col" style="width:33%">Path 1</th>
    <th scope="col" style="width:33%">Path 2</th>
    <th scope="col" style="width:33%">Path 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width:33%">Some people who are already familiar with online marketing will opt to <strong>start off in Expert Mode</strong>.</td>
    <td style="width:33%">Some people will start off in Smart Mode, learn more about online advertising, and at some point decide to <strong>switch from Smart Mode to Expert Mode</strong>.</td>
    <td style="width:33%">Some people will choose to <strong>stay in Smart Mode</strong>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each path leads to success! Which you choose depends on what features are important to you and how much time you're willing and able to devote to advertising.
