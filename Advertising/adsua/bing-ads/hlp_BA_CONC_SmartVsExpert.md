When you first [get started with smart campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Intro.md) in Microsoft Advertising, you're in Smart Mode. Smart Mode is a streamlined, simple experience that lets Microsoft Advertising's AI take care of most of the nuts and bolts of ad campaign management. It's a great way for small businesses and novice advertisers to start off advertising on the Microsoft Search Network.

Expert Mode is the full-featured Microsoft Advertising experience. It gives you more control over campaign management, lets you add more content to your ads, and provides much more in the way of performance reporting and tracking.

People starting out in Microsoft Advertising can take three different paths:
