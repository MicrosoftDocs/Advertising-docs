# Introducing Hotel Ads

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hotel Ads is currently under controlled beta testing and is available to select advertisers only. Please contact your account manager for details on how you may be able to join.

Hotel Ads is a hotel search experience designed to showcase your real-time room rates to potential customers on the Bing search results pages and within Bing Maps. Hotel Ads complement your existing ad campaigns, allowing you to reach travelers who are looking to book now.

## The benefits of Hotel Ads

- **Drive bookings.**  When customers are searching for hotels, Hotel Ads will connect them to you directly.
- **Showcase offerings.**  Hotel Ads’ search experience showcases your hotel listings within the Bing search results page, as well as Bing Maps.
- **Get additional insight.**  Learn about your potential customers by gaining insight with hotels and bookings reporting.
- **Complement existing text and dynamic search Ads.**

## How does Hotel Ads fit within Microsoft Advertising?

Hotel Ads integrates seamlessly within your Microsoft Shopping Campaigns customer level and account(s). We recommend that you create a new account within an existing customer level for Hotel Ads or enable Hotel Ads within an existing text ad and/or dynamic search ad account. You can create a new customer ID just for Hotel Ads, but we don’t recommend this, as you’ll need create an additional UET tag to be placed on your site to properly track conversions across two separate accounts.

**The Hotel Ads structure**           
Hotel Ads has five levels of organization: customer, accounts, subaccounts, hotel groups, and hotels.

- A **customer**  contains one or more accounts. A customer has a customer ID, which is associated with your business name and your address. At the customer level, at least one person is designated as the Super admin. Super admins have administrative access to all accounts.
- **Accounts**  contain one or more campaigns and include information about currency, time zone, whether you want to pay in advance (prepay) or pay later (postpay), your form of payment (primary payment method), and the people who have access to each account (users).
- **Subaccounts**  contain one or more hotel groups and specifies your daily budget, default bid and bid multipliers, and a maximum bid cap for all of your hotels.
- **Hotel groups**  are optional and belong within a single subaccount, containing one or more hotels. Once you’ve onboarded to Hotel Ads, all of your hotels will belong to the “Ungrouped” hotel group. A hotel group can either override its subaccount’s bid or bid multipliers or inherit them.
- **Hotels**  are at the lowest level where bids and bid multipliers can be set. Hotels can inherit bids and multipliers from a hotel group or directly from the subaccount. You can also specify bids and multipliers at the hotel level, which will override the hotel group or subaccount level settings.

## Get started with Hotel Ads

## FAQs

- **What bid amount should I use to start out?**              We recommend beginning with bids similar to what you use for your Google Hotel Ads. If you’re not currently using Google Hotel Ads, a fixed bid of 1 USD can be used to start. You can then adjust accordingly.
- **How should I organize my hotels?**              That depends on what your needs are. In general, if you require:
   1. **A different budget for different sets of hotels** , you can set up a unique subaccount for each set of hotels. This way, you can define the daily budget used for the hotels within the subaccount.
   1. **A different bid or bid multiplier for different sets of hotels** , you can set up hotels within hotel groups.
   1. **Different billing options** , you can create a separate Microsoft Advertising  account and subaccount within it. For example, for international hotels, you can use the **Hotel Assignment** tab to move the desired hotels within the appropriate account/subaccount combination.

- **What's the difference between "Active hotels" and "All hotels"?**              "Active hotels" are currently live in your feed. "All hotels" include hotels currently live in your feed, as well as hotels that have been removed in the past and are no longer active. Removed hotels are included in "All hotels" to reflect an overall view of your historical performance data.
