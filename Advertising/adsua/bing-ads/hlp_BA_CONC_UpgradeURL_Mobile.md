# Can I set a separate URL for my mobile website?

You can now define a separate URL for mobile devices. Before if you wanted to set a mobile URL, you needed to add URL parameters. Now all you need to do is select a final URL and you will see a separate box to enter your mobile URL.

The benefits of a separate mobile URL:

- Easier to read
- Intent is clear and distinct. You can take customers to a webpage that is optimized for smaller devices

<table fullBrowserOnly="true" hideExternalLink="true" type="type2" style="border:0;padding:10px">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Here is an example of what a final and mobile URL can look like for a Contact Us page:</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> ![Final and mobile URL example](../images/BA_ScreenCap_FinalMobile.png)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
