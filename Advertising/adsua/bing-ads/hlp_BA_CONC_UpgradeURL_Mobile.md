# Can I set a separate URL for my mobile website?

You can now define a separate URL for mobile devices. Before if you wanted to set a mobile URL, you needed to add URL parameters. Now all you need to do is select a final URL and you will see a separate box to enter your mobile URL.

The benefits of a separate mobile URL:

- Easier to read
- Intent is clear and distinct. You can take customers to a webpage that is optimized for smaller devices

|Here is an example of what a final and mobile URL can look like for a Contact Us page:|
