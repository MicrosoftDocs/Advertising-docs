# LinkedIn profile targeting

Microsoft Advertising is the only advertising platform (other than LinkedIn) that allows you to target potential customers based on their LinkedIn profile information. You can target customers based on their:

- **Company** , such as Microsoft, Alibaba.com, or KLM Royal Dutch Air Lines.
- **Industry** , such as finance, broadcast media, or law enforcement.
- **Job function** , such as sales, accounting, or purchasing.

LinkedIn profile targeting is available for search campaigns, dynamic search ad campaigns, Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, and audience campaigns.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all possible companies, industries, and job functions are available for targeting. We are constantly expanding our lists, so if you don't see what you're looking for, check again later.

1. For each target type, click **Edit target**.

1. Click **Done** for each target type.
1. Finally, set a bid adjustment for each target.

> [!NOTE]
> LinkedIn profile targeting will not narrow your ads' audience. For example, by targeting a specific company, you aren't excluding everyone who does not work for that company. If you're familiar with remarketing list targeting, you can think of LinkedIn profile targeting as "bid only", as opposed to "target and bid".
