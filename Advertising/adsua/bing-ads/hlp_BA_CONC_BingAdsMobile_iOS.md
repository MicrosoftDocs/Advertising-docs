Having trouble signing in? Here are solutions to some of the reasons why you might be having issues:

- **Solution #1**: To resolve this issue, you'll need to transition to using a Microsoft account to sign in. This enables you to sign into Microsoft Advertising using your email address and password.

- **Solution #2**: If your company is already using Microsoft Advertising, reach out to the person who manages the account and ask them to invite you as a new user. Once they do, you’ll be able to set yourself up as a user on the account and will then be able to sign in to the app successfully.
