# Minimum bid for Microsoft Shopping Campaigns

Your **bid** is the highest price that you want to pay each time someone clicks on your ad. Microsoft Advertising requires these bids to be at least 0.01 for the shopping tab and 0.05 for everywhere else. This allows you to target all your offers that you would otherwise miss out on for your shopping campaigns.

One important thing to keep in mind is that product offers with less than 0.05 bids are eligible to serve in the **shopping tab** only. The shopping tab is currently available in the following markets: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For product offers to be eligible to serve everywhere else in the search network, the minimum bid amount should be the recommended minimum bid (see below).

Bid values in Microsoft Shopping Campaigns can be provided at the following levels:
- Product group
- Ad group
- Campaign
