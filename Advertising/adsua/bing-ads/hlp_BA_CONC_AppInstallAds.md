# App install ads: Drive app downloads

> [!NOTE]
> App Install Ads are available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
> Microsoft Advertising only supports iOS and Android apps in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store in the United States. There is no support for apps on Windows or Windows Phone.

App install ads are an ideal solution if you want to manage and drive downloads of your apps, rather than website traffic. Because these ads automaticall detect a customer's mobile device and operating system, they provide direct links to your app, sending customers directly to the applicable store to download the application.

You only pay for app installs, and you can track conversions when you set up a measurement URL with a conversion tracking partner such as AppsFlyer, Kochava, Tune, Singular, Adjust, or Branch.

## Compare app install ads and app extensions

An app install ad is similar to an ad with an associated [app extension](./hlp_BA_CONC_AdExtensionAppExtension.md). They both use third-party measurement URLs to track conversion goals. Both include app icons and send users to the app store as appropriate for the device they are using. Here are some key differences:

## What you’ll need before you create an app install ad

When you create an app install ad, you’ll want basic information on hand: **mobile operating system**, **app ID/package name**, **link text**, and **link URL**.

Consider if you’d like to report app installs as a conversion goal. If you do, you’ll want to sign up with a Microsoft Advertising-certified partner to view app installs as conversions within the Microsoft Advertising report. Check out [tracking conversions](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2MobileApp.md) for help setting up those goals.

Whether or not your ad shows on mobile devices only depends on several things, including your ad group device preferences and if you have other ads in your ad group. App install ads will serve on mobile and tablet devices, but if you prefer that your ads appear on mobile devices, be sure to select **Prefer mobile devices**. Selecting this preference doesn't mean that your ads will be excluded from tablets.

Your App ID can be found in the URL of the app from the respective app store.

- Windows Store			  http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/example-app-name/**12345678-9abc-1234-1234-1234567890ab**
- Windows Phone Store			  http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/example-app-name/**12345678-9abc-1234-1234-1234567890ab)**
- Google Play			  http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=**com.example.appname**
- Apple App Store			  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/example-app-name/id**#########**

App install ads will serve on mobile and tablet devices, but if you prefer your ads appear on mobile devices, be sure to check the **Prefer mobile devices** box. Whether your ad only shows on mobile devices depends on several things, including your ad group device preferences and if you have other ads in your ad group. Selecting this preference doesn't mean that your ads will be excluded from tablets.

If your mobile app is brand new, it can take up to 96 hours for the data to populate. For existing apps, it can take up to 24 hours.
- **App icons**: After new thumbnails for app icons are created, it can take up 10 days for them to go live.
- **App URL details**: It can take up to three to four days for the updated details to refresh.
