# Set up UET tags using Signal

> [!NOTE]
> This article shows how to do a basic setup of UET tags with Signal. Signal offers several advanced features to customize when and how your tags are fired. Please refer to Signal's [Tag Management 101](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2010459) for more information.

Tag managers replace static tags with dynamic tags that are easier to implement and update. The dynamic tag is a container, a small snippet of code that allows you to dynamically insert tags into your website. You can think of the container tag as a bucket that holds other types of tags.

## Implementing UET using Signal

1. Set up an account in Signal, if you haven't already.
1. In Signal, go to the **Tags** tab and click **Add a Tag**.
1. Type "smart custom" into the search bar.
1. From the **Client Tag Selection** screen, select the **Smart Custom Tag (Client-Side)** tag.
1. In the **Smart Custom Tag (Client-Side)** page, paste your Microsoft Advertising UET tag ID in the **Custom Markup** field. You can find the tag in Microsoft Advertising by selecting **Conversion Tracking**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**UET tags**. When you're done, click **Create Tag**.
1. You will be directed to your tag's **Assign Inputs to Smart Custom Tag (Client-Side)** page. For each page of your website you'd like assign the tag to, click its **Unassigned** button (which will flip it to **Assigned**).
1. Back on the **Smart Custom Tag (Client-Side)** page, click **Active** in the upper right corner of the  screen to activate your tag.
1. In Signal's left pane, select **Data Dictionary** to add data elements as necessary to your inputs.

> [!NOTE]
> To see an example of an Signal UET tag installed in the body of a webpage, visit our [Signal sample page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2010829) (English only), right-click in the webpage, and then click **View source** or **View page source** depending on your browser.
> As your webpage loads, it triggers the UET tag, resulting in a number of HTTP requests. The most important request is to "bat.bing" (the one that looks like "http://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=..."). This request tells Microsoft Advertising  about the user visits to your webpage. You can use third-party tools such as Fiddler to monitor all the requests that your browser is making when your webpage loads.
> We currently do not support reporting UET [custom events](./hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2CustomEvent.md) or [revenue variables](./hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2RevenueVariables.md) from Signal.
