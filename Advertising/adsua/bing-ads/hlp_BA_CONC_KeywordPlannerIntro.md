# How to use Keyword Planner

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword Planner is now available to all customers, and more capabilities are coming soon!

Choosing keywords is one of the most important aspects of creating and maintaining a successful advertising campaign. But where to start? How do you identify the many possible keywords that describe your business? How much should you bid on those keywords to be competitive with other advertisers?

Keyword Planner can help answer all of these questions and more. Better yet, after identifying potential ad groups with keywords and finding the profitable bids, you can use Keyword Planner to directly save those keywords to your account.

Keyword Planner is a valuable tool for new advertisers and PPC veterans alike. Use it when just starting a campaign or anytime to expand and improve your ads' performance and reach.

[Go to Keyword Planner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=624008). (When you click the link, you will need to sign in to Microsoft Advertising if you aren't currently signed in.)
