# See how you compete with the auction insights report

The auction insights report shows you how your ads compete with other advertisers' ads. The report is based on the number of impressions that have auction insights available divided by total impressions for all the keywords in your selected scope.

Every time someone performs a search on the Microsoft Search Network,     Microsoft Advertising runs an ad auction to determine which ads are shown and where they are placed on the search results page. Auction insights provide performance    data per display URL domain on key statistics, including impression share and average position.

## Run the report
1. From the main menu on the far left, select **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, select either **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, or **Keywords**.
1. Select **Auction Insights**.
1. Select **Download** and then select the **Format** and **Segment** of the report.
1. Select **Download**.

 
## Read the report

The auction insights report reveals data on key performance statistics for you and your competitors.

**Display url domain** lists the display URLs of other advertisers who are participating in the same auctions as you.

The six statistics shown are impression share, average position, overlap rate, position above rate, top of page (mainline) rate, and outranking share.    Click each column in the report to learn more. Here’s what each of the key metrics means:

- **Impression share**: The number of times an ad is shown on the Microsoft Search Network divided by the total available impressions. Use this to compare your share of impressions to the impression share of advertisers competing against you.
- **Average position**: The average position on the web page for ads that were delivered. Although it varies, positions 1-4 appear at the top of the search results page and positions 5-10 appear in other locations (for example, the bottom or the sidebar). Use this to compare your ad position with the average rank of all ads in the auction.
- **Overlap rate**: The percentage of time competitors’ ads showed up on the search results page when your ad was shown.  If the rate is high then this advertiser is a competitor since their ads shows up on the same search results page as yours.
- **Position above rate**: The percentage of time competitors’ ads showed up higher than your ads on the search results page. If the rate is high then the other advertiser is getting more desirable ad positions than you. A high rate is likely due to a poor quality score or a low bid.
- **Top of page (mainline) rate**: The number of times an ad is shown at the top of the page on the Microsoft Search Network, divided by the total number of impressions it actually received. Ads at the top of the page tend to receive more clicks.
- **Outranking share**: The percentage of time your ad showed up higher on the search results pages than your competitors or your ad showed when theirs did not. If the rate is high, you are getting a more desirable ad position than other advertisers.

By showing you where you are succeeding and where you might be missing opportunities for improved performance, the auction insights report can help you make strategic optimization decisions.

> [!NOTE]
> The auction insights report will only run if you have enough impressions. If this is a new campaign or if you have too few impressions, the report will not be generated.
> The competing websites listed in your auction insights report are those who enter the same auctions as you, and are eligible for the same impressions that you are.      Competitors aren't necessarily determined on how similar their keywords, match types, or other targeting settings are to your own, and auction insights doesn't provide a full report      on these metrics for other advertisers.
> The data retention period for the auction insights report is 180 days.
