# Get billing alerts

## Billing alerts via email

Sign up to receive billing alerts for when your billing documents are ready or when there's an issue with your payment. The types of emails you receive depend on how you pay for  Microsoft Advertising.

- **For prepay accounts**, you'll receive an end-of-month email that links you to the summary of your prepayments for the month.
- **For postpay threshold accounts**, you'll receive an end-of-month email that links you to the Billing tab. There, you can see all the payments you made once you reached your monthly billing date or your payment threshold, whichever came first. [Learn more about billing threshold](./hlp_BA_CONC_BillingThreshold.md).
- **For monthly invoice billing**, you'll receive an email that links you to the Billing tab, where you can see your invoice.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a Super Admin, you can set email preferences for other users. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)

## Monthly invoices via email

If you have a monthly invoice account, we can send your invoices via email to your accounts payable contacts on file. A Super Admin can designate anyone to be an accounts payable contactâ€”including those without a Microsoft Advertising account. Go to Billing settings to update a contact's information.
