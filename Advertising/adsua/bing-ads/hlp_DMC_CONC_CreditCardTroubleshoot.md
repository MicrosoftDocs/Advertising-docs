# Unified Smart campaigns: Credit cards and billing

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Your search ads will be eligible to run once you have added a primary payment method. We charge your primary payment method when you reach your billing threshold or your monthly billing date, whichever comes first. Your monthly billing date is the date that you signed up for Unified Smart campaigns.

## Billing Threshold

When met, the billing threshold is a set amount that triggers billing for advertising costs. For example, in your first 30-day period, your charges are well below your billing threshold of $25, so we charge your primary payment method on your monthly billing date. In the next 30-day period, you hit your billing threshold a few days before your monthly billing date, so we charge your primary payment method at that time.

Your primary payment method will be charged on your monthly billing date unless you have made a successful payment within the past 10 days, either by reaching your billing threshold or by paying your account balance. Your card can be charged multiple times a month each time ad spend reaches your billing threshold. You will be able to see how much you spend in search ads versus social ads, but you won't be able to see the spend on each individual ad platform.

> [!NOTE]
> To view your billing threshold, select the profile picture the upper-right corner of any Unified Smart campaigns  page and then select **Billing and payments**. The threshold is shown in the **Current search advertising balance** tile.

Billing thresholds start out low and will automatically increase when you make successful payments. The amount of increase depends on your currency and other factors. Alternatively, Microsoft Advertising automatically decreases your billing threshold if you run into problems paying your charges.

For example, let’s say that you signed up for Microsoft Advertising on October 22 and have an account billed in U.S. dollars. As a new customer, your billing threshold is set by default to $25 and your monthly billing date is the 22nd of each month. From October 22 to November 21, you spend $23.50, so we charge you that amount on November 22, your first monthly billing date. Your campaign takes off in late November and by December 7, you have $30 in charges. We charge your payment method on December 8. You reach the billing threshold 2 more times, and we increase it to $50.

> [!NOTE]
> For businesses located in the United States, billing is managed by Microsoft Online, Inc. in the United States, and Microsoft Advertising is not required to charge taxes on advertising costs.
> Microsoft Advertising cannot provide guidance on tax. Please contact your tax advisor or local tax office if you have questions.

## Add a payment method

Follow these steps to add a credit or debit card as your payment method:

1. In the upper-right corner of any Unified Smart campaigns page, select the profile picture, and then select **Billing and payments**.
1. In the **Payment for search advertising** tile, select **Add new card**.
1. In the drop-down list, choose payment method type.
   - **Primary payment method**: Payment method charged for search advertising.
   - **Backup payment method**: Payment method that will be used if the primary payment method didn’t cover all charges.
   - **Additional payment method**: Payment method that is only charged if you make a one-time payment, or if you later set it as the primary or backup payment method.

1. Enter your credit or debit card number without spaces or punctuation.
1. Enter the rest of the billing details and then select **Save**.

You can only remove payment methods that are classified as **additional**. If you only have one card in Microsoft Advertising, add another card, and assign it as the new primary card. Once that is updated, you can remove your previous primary card. To remove a backup payment method, you must first designate it as an additional payment method.

Inactive accounts cannot be reactivated if they are associated with an expired or otherwise invalid payment method or if the account has had too many declined payments. If you are unable to add a valid payment method, create a new account and enter your credit or debit card information in the new account.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Advertising occasionally provides promotional offers or coupons. Although you can't request a promotional offer, you can find them through Microsoft Advertising promotional events, online marketing drives, or other special offers. Promotional offers may require that you spend money on your advertising campaigns first to get a credit toward advertising. The **Promotional offers** tile is shown on the **Billing and payments** page.

## Make a one-time payment

You can pay the charges on your account before it reaches your billing threshold or your next billing cycle. Partial payments are not accepted.

1. In the upper-right corner of any Unified Smart campaigns  page, select the profile picture and then select **Billing and payments**.
1. Select **Pay account balance** from the **Current search advertising balance** tile.
1. Select the payment method you want to use.
1. Select **Pay now**.

## Credit and debit card requirements

Please note the following requirements for credit and debit cards:

- Unified Smart campaigns accepts credit and debit cards only for example, VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Network). We do not accept payments by prepaid cards.
- Unified Smart campaigns doesn't accept cards that require you to enter a PIN/security verification when making a payment.
- Enter your name precisely as it appears on the card. Only include your middle initial if it appears on your card.
- If your address exceeds the **Address 1** field, then use the **Address 2** field. Do not shorten or abbreviate your address.
- The card number and type cannot be edited, so if you make a mistake, you'll need to add a new one with the correct information.

Contact your credit card company in the following situations:

- To make sure you're authorized to use this card for online purchases and automatic billing.
- The credit card has expired, has been reported lost or stolen, has reached its transaction limit, or is new and hasn't been activated.
- Required multi-factor authentication failed. Your bank might require multi-factor authentication to help prevent online fraud and unauthorized access to your account. If the one-time passcode didn't work, try resending the code or adding the card again. If this doesn't resolve the issue, please contact your bank to validate your information.
