# Where do I view conversion goal metric data?

> [!NOTE]
> In Microsoft Advertising, conversions are reported on the time of the click that led to the conversion. Similarly, assists are reported on the time of the click that contributed to a conversion.

There are three places in Microsoft Advertising where conversion data can be viewed:

**Conversion goals page** : You can see the conversions, revenue, and repeat rate metrics. You can change the date range in the upper right corner of the page to control the time period for the metrics. Click **Campaigns** at the top of the page, and then on the left pane, click **Conversion Tracking** and then **Conversion goals** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** and then **Conversion goals**).

**Campaigns** : The following conversion metrics can be added to the Campaigns, Ad groups, Ads, Keywords, and Ad extensions tables by clicking **Columns** and then **Modify columns**.

- Conversions
- Conversion rate\*
- Revenue
- CPA\*
- Revenue on ad spend

**\*Conversion rate and CPA are calculated based on clicks that could lead to conversions. For example, clicks that happened after a conversion goal was enabled.**

**Reports** . The following reports include conversion data:
