# Set up UET tags using Adobe Dynamic Tag Management

> [!NOTE]
> This article shows how to do a basic setup of UET tags with Adobe Dynamic Tag Management (DTM). Adobe DTM offers several advanced features to customize when and how your tags are fired. Please refer to the [Adobe Help Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2010800) for more information.

Tag managers replace static tags with dynamic tags that are easier to implement and update. The dynamic tag is a container, a small snippet of code that allows you to dynamically insert tags into your website. You can think of the container tag as a bucket that holds other types of tags.

## Implementing UET using Adobe DTM

1. Set up an account in Adobe DTM, if you haven't already.
1. In Adobe DTM, navigate to your website's dashboard.
1. Click the **Embed** tab.
1. Click **Header Code**. Copy this code and paste it into your website's header.
1. Click **Footer Code**. Copy this code and paste it into your website's footer.
1. In Adobe DTM, click the **Rules** tab and then **Page Load Rule** (there are other rule types, such as event-based rules, but for the purposes of this example, we'll stick with **Page Load Rule**).
1. Give your rule a name and select a category for it.
1. Expand the **JavaScript / Third Party Tags** section.
1. Click **Add New Script** and then:
   1. For **Type**, select **Non-Sequential JavaScript**.
   1. In the script section, paste your Microsoft Advertising UET code. You can find the tag in Microsoft Advertising by selecting **Conversion Tracking**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**UET tags**.
   1. When you're done, click **Save Code**.

1. Click the **Approvals** tab and approve these changes.
1. From your website's Adobe DTM dashboard, click **Publish Queue** and follow the steps to publish the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> To see an example of an Adobe DTM UET tag installed in the body of a webpage, visit our [Adobe DTM sample page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2010473) (English only), right-click in the webpage, and then click **View source** or **View page source** depending on your browser.
> As your webpage loads, it triggers the UET tag, resulting in a number of HTTP requests. The most important request is to "bat.bing" (the one that looks like "http://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=..."). This request tells Microsoft Advertising  about the user visits to your webpage. You can use third-party tools such as Fiddler to monitor all the requests that your browser is making when your webpage loads.
