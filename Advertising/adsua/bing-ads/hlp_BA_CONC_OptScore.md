# About your optimization score

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

The optimization score is an estimate of how well you’re set up to get the most from your account or campaign. Sitting atop the Recommendations page, your optimization score runs from 0% to 100%, with 100% meaning that your account or campaigns can function at full potential. Applying the recommendations below it can positively impact your campaigns, and in turn, boost the overall optimization score.

> [!NOTE]
> An optimization score is only shown for active search campaigns at the campaign and account level.
> Both your account and campaign level Recommendation pages have their own optimization score.

## Understanding score uplifts

The score uplift highlights the estimated impact a recommendation or a group of recommendations has towards your campaign metrics and contributes to your optimization score.

## How we calculate your optimization score

Your optimization score is a real-time calculation based on the settings, performance, and status of your account and campaigns. The relevant impact of available recommendations and recent recommendations history also contribute to this calculation. Your optimization score and the available recommendations below it may change based on many factors, ranging from your settings to trends in the ads ecosystem. You may see a different score and a new set of recommendations when these changes happen.
