# Download and print a billing statement or invoice

You can download and print your billing information at any time from [the Billing tab](./hlp_BA_CONC_BillingTab.md), including payments you've made (billing statements), bills you've received (invoices), and credit or debit adjustments.

[!INCLUDE [ViewBillingStatement_VR](./includes/ViewBillingStatement_VR.md)]
After you download the PDF documents, you can print them from your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> Statements and invoices are always based on Pacific Time.
