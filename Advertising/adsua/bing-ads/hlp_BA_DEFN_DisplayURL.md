# Display URL - Definition

## What it is

The webpage address that appears in your ad, which is different than the final URL that is the webpage URL people are taken to after they click your ad. It is normally shown in green text.

![Example of an ad](../images/BA_Misc_AdExample.jpg)

## Why it's important

It gives people a clear idea of where they will go when they click your ad.

## What you need to know

When creating your ad, we recommend using a simple, easy-to-read display URL and defining a longer final URL to send people to a more specific area of your website.

## An example

In the image above, Blue Yonder Airlines is advertising low fares to Europe this summer. The display URL (wwww.BlueYonderAirlines.com) lets people know where they are going when they click the ad and the final URL can be www.BlueYonderAirlines.com/europesummersale.

> [!NOTE]
> If your website address begins with a subdomain (for example, packages in packages.BlueYonderAirlines.com), your display URL should include the subdomain as well.
> Since you want the display URL to tell people where they are going when they click the ad, we recommend that the display URL and the final URL are on the same domain. For example, both the display and final URL are going to the domain BlueYonderAirlines.com.
