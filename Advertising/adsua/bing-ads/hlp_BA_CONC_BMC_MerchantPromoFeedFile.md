# What can I include in my Merchant Promotion feed file?

Your feed file is a text delimited file that contains all the information needed to submit a promotion. For manual uploads, .tsv or .xml file formats are accepted. For FTP uploads (available in the United States only), .tsv, .txt, or .xml file formats are accepted. After you create a feed file, [      submit it to Microsoft Merchant Center    ](./hlp_BA_CONC_BMCWhatIsCatalog.md).

**Availability**: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, India, France, and Germany on PC and mobile devices.

Here are the required and optional fields you can include in the catalog feed:
