Once you have been enabled for Hotel Ads, you can access Microsoft Hotel Center by selecting **Tools** > **Hotel center**. After you launch Microsoft Hotel Center, you’ll see three tabs that contain a set of core functionalities to assist with managing, scaling, and improving the performance of your Hotel Ads on Bing: **Overview**, **Assignment**, and **Intelligence**.

## The Overview tab

View hotel performance data and inline capabilities to set bids, budgets, and bid multiplier settings of your subaccounts.

The table in the Overview tab will display your subaccount’s hotel, hotel group, subaccount, date, device type, hotel country, length of stay, user country, and slot type data. You can view both active and inactive hotel performance and download your subaccount’s data directly from the table.

## The Assignment tab

Create new, rename, or delete hotel groups; assign ungrouped hotels to a group; or move hotels from one hotel group to another in the Assignment tab.

## The Intelligence tab

Access tools and reports to improve the quality of your feeds and feed coverage from the Intelligence tab.

- **Feeds**  allows you to upload your hotel list in either CSV or XML format.
- **Reports**  helps you understand the data issues that may be preventing you from advertising on hotels.
- **Ad Extensions**  guides you through creating ad extensions for your subaccounts and hotel groups.
