# Managing your India tax ID

Advertisers based in India must provide either a company or an individual Permanent Account Number (PAN) as it appears on the PAN card.

PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric code supplied to individuals and businesses in India by the Indian Income Tax Department. New and current advertisers with a business location of India will be asked to provide their PAN. Without this number, India-based advertisers will not be able to use Microsoft Advertising.

If you have a Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), you can provide that information, but it is optional. Similar to PAN, GSTIN is a 15-digit alphanumeric code supplied to taxpayers and businesses in India by state authorities to aid with tax collection.

Microsoft Advertising cannot provide guidance on tax. Please contact your tax advisor or local tax office if you have questions.

## Changing your Permanent Account Number and Goods and Services Tax Identification Number

You can provide your company or individual Permanent Account Number (PAN) when you sign up for  Microsoft Advertising and each time you create a new account.

If you are a monthly invoice customer, please contact your account manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to update your PAN information.
