# Dynamic text: Capitalization of the keyword placeholder

You can use the *{KeyWord}* placeholder to make your ad title, ad text, and display URL display keywords that match, or closely match, the text that a customer types. Write your ad, and then insert the *{KeyWord}* placeholder where you want the keyword to appear. However, the way you capitalize *{KeyWord}* determines how the words in the keyword are capitalized in your ad.

## {KeyWord} capitalization options

Capitalization options for keyword placeholders help you to make sure your ad always looks great to your customers.

Suppose your business delivers fresh fruit and vegetables that customers order online, and you want each keyword to be capitalized in your ad title no matter how a person types it in a Bing, AOL, or Yahoo search. Capitalizing the placeholder as *{KeyWord}* makes "fresh fruit", "Fresh fruit", and even "FRESH fruit" always appear in your ad title as "Fresh Fruit".

Here's how several ad titles change based on the capitalization options you select for the *{KeyWord}* placeholder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The capitalization options apply only to the ad title, ad description, and display URL, and to campaigns and ad groups running in the following languages:      English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish.

Microsoft Advertising policies specify that you can't have more than one fully capitalized word in your ad title or ad text. For example, you can say "Order FRESH fruit today" but not "Order FRESH fruit TODAY." For more info, go to our article [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md), and in "Ad content and style policies" for your country or region, select the section on capitalization.

For information on the other types of dynamic text supported by Microsoft Advertising, see [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutParameters.md).
