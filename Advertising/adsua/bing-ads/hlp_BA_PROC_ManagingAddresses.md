Your company's legally registered business address is critical information that you will need to keep on file and up to date. We use your business address to help determine whether you will be [charged tax or VAT on your advertising costs](./hlp_BA_CONC_EuropaFAQ.md). If you have a monthly invoice account, please note:
- You must contact your Account Manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to change your business address.
- If you receive correspondence at a location other than your business address, you will also need to provide your mailing address.

## Update your business address
If you have a monthly invoice account, please contact your Account Manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to update your business address.
