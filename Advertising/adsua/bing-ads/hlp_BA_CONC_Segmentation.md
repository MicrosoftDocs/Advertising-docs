# Segment your performance data

Segmentation allows you to split your Account Summary or Campaign page performance data into rows based on Time, Conversions, Audience, Network, Device and Top vs. Other. For example, you can segment your impression,     click, and CTR data by device to see what devices your audience is seeing your ad on. This gives you greater insights into how your campaigns are doing and you no longer have to go to the Reports page to get this level of detail.

## Add segments to the table
1. On the **Account Summary** or **Campaigns** page, click **Segment** and then select the one you want to apply (or from the global menu on the top of the page, click an account or from the main menu on the far left, click a campaign. Then on the table toolbar, click **Segment**).            
|Segment|What it shows|
|---|---|
|Time|View your data by time (day, week, month, quarter, year, day of week).|
|Conversions|View your data by goal name or goal type (For example: Destination URL, Offline conversions). Please note that this segment shows data related to conversions only.|
|Audience|View your data by audience name or catagory (For example: Remarketing list, In-Market audience)|
|Device Type|View your data by device type (smartphone, tablet, or PC).|
|Network|The combined search advertising marketplace of the Microsoft Search Network.|
|Top vs. Other|The position (mainline vs. bottom or sidebar) of your ad on the Microsoft Search Network search results page.|

1. Review your data split out by segment.

## Download segmented data in a report
Once you have your data the way you want it, you can [download it into a .csv or Excel report](./hlp_BA_CONC_DownloadTableAsReport.md) to conveniently share the information with your clients, or use for further analysis.

## Remove segments from the table
On the **Account Summary** or **Campaigns** page, click **Segment** and then **None** (or from the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns** and from the page menu, click **Campaigns**. Then on the table toolbar, click **Segment** and click **None**).

Some segmentation types only have data for a specific period of time. Here is a summary of what is available and what date ranges you should avoid if using that segment.

|If you select|The minimum amount of data|The maximum amount of data|Date ranges to avoid|
|---|---|---|---|
|Day|1 day|16 days|Last 30 days and anything longer than this|
|Week|1 week|17 weeks|Today, Yesterday, This week (all versions), Last 7 days, Last week (all versions), Last 6 months and anything longer than this|
|Month|1 month|17 months|Today, Yesterday, This week (all versions), Last 7 days, Last week (all versions), Last 14 days, This month, Last 30 days, Last month, Entire time. If you select "This week" before the week is over or "This month" before the month is over, we won't be able to segment the data.|
