Keyword Planner is a valuable tool for new advertisers and PPC veterans alike. Use it when you're just starting a campaign or anytime to expand and improve your ads' performance and reach. You can use Keyword Planner to organize your keywords into meaningful ad groups and campaigns.

To get data on keyword searches, click **Get search volume data and trend** from the Keyword Planner. For performance and cost estimates on keywords, click **Get performance and cost estimates for keywords**.

## Understanding your search volume statistics
When you view search volume for specific keywords, a table containing historical statistics will display. This data is based on the **Location**, **Search Network Targeting**, and **Date range** you select from the sidebar to the left. Here’s what the data in the table below the graph means:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" scope="col">
                Average monthly searches
              </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
                <strong>What it is:</strong>
                <para>The number of times this keyword was used as a search term based on the location and network targeting settings you’ve selected. By default, we average the number of searches for the term over a 12-month period.</para></td>
    <td>
                <strong>What you need to know:</strong>
                <para>
                  Date range and targeting settings are used when calculating this number, but the language setting is not.
                  If we don’t have enough data for this keyword, you will see a dash (-).
                  This number does not take into account keyword match types.
                </para></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" scope="col">
              Competition
            </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
              <strong>What it is:</strong>
              <para>The number of advertisers bidding on this keyword, relative to all other keywords across Microsoft Advertising. Possible values are "Low," "Medium," and "High." </para></td>
    <td>
              <strong>What you need to know:</strong>
              <para>This information is based on the location and other targeting criteria you have specified. If we don't have enough data, the value will display as a dash (-).</para></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" scope="col">
              Suggested bid
            </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
              <strong>What it is:</strong>
              <para>The suggested minimum bid for this keyword.</para></td>
    <td>
              <strong>What you need to know:</strong>
              <para>We create this suggestion using the location and network target settings you selected, along with the average cost-per-click (CPC) advertisers are paying for this keyword.</para><para>This amount is only an estimate and your actual CPC may vary.</para></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" scope="col">
              Ad impression share
            </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
              <strong>What it is:</strong>
              <para>The number of impressions you've received divided by the total number of searches for the location and network you're targeting that matched the keyword exactly in the last calendar month.</para></td>
    <td>
              <strong>What you need to know:</strong>
              <para>The ad impression share column in the Keyword Planner is different than the impression share in auction insights, which is based on the number of impressions you were eligible to receive for a keyword.</para><para>Ad impression share is based on the search volume for that exact keyword. When you see a dash (-) in the ad impression share column, that means we don't have enough data to calculate this number.</para></td>
  </tr>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> The search volume statistics are rounded. As a result, the search volume for keyword suggestions for multiple locations may not add up as you might expect.
> Internet traffic varies by many factors, such as seasons or current events. Keep in mind that the number of searches on your keywords will constantly vary because of this.
> Choose keywords based on quality over quantity. The more relevant a keyword is, the better results you’ll get. Selecting keywords with higher search traffic or more competition doesn’t mean that it’s the right keyword for your advertising goals

## Understanding your performance and cost estimates
You can also use Keyword Planner to get traffic estimates for your keywords. You can see an overview on the graph and more details in the table below it.

They typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the Microsoft Audience Network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for examples, spiders, robots, test servers).

## Understanding your traffic estimates
After seeing the estimates related to keyword performances and cost, you might wonder why you are seeing certain traffic estimates. Here are some reasons that can impact how your traffic estimates display.
- **Limited by budget**: You may sometimes see a shaded area in the graph. This means that our system estimates that your budget is too low to accommodate all the clicks and impressions available for your keywords for the shaded bids. You may also see the line in the graph curving down. This means that the estimated number of clicks your keywords might get are decreasing as your bid increases.          ![Limited by budget](../images/BA_SCREENCAP_KeywordPlannerStatisticsAndForecasts_LimitedByBudget.png)
To get more clicks and impressions, try increasing your daily budget. By increasing your budget, your ads may get more clicks and impressions. You can also try to lower bid, as it might reduce the average amount you pay when your ad gets clicked and help your budget go further to get more clicks.

- **Estimates are not available in the tables**: If you haven’t entered a bid and daily budget (optional), you will see dashes “-“ in the table. Enter **Bid amount** and **Daily budget** (optional) above the graph and click **Get estimates** to view the weekly estimates.
If you see a dash “-“ instead of a number in the **Avg. Position** column, our system determined that your ad will likely not get any impressions. Historical ad performance for your ad and other ads using similar keywords are used to calculate the average position. Usually, you’ll see a dash when different factors like your bid or click-through rates aren’t sufficient to earn an ad position. Try to increase your bid amount to get an average position estimate.

## Comparing your ad impression share to competitor domains and market leader domains
To get a sense of your ad impression share compared to competitor domains or market leader domains, use the "Search volume trends" from the drop-down menu and select "Compared to competitor domains" or "Compared to market leader domains." Since your ad impression share is calculated over the last calendar month for keyword ideas, it won’t change with date range selection.
- **Compared to competitor domains**: This report can help you identify missed opportunities with existing products, so you can focus on the keywords where your ad impression share is low compared to advertisers like you.
- **Compared to market leader domains**: The market leader domains graph compares your ad impression share to the average ad impression share of the top five market leader domains for your keyword suggestions.

> [!NOTE]
> The competitor domains and market leader domains reports will not reveal the actual keywords, quality, bids, or settings from your campaigns to other advertisers, nor will they show that information for your competitor domains and market leader domains.
