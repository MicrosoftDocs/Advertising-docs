## Dates for Promotion Extensions

There are three different date ranges to keep in mind for Promotion Extension to deliver. For an example, you want to run a promotion for the new year. You select **New Year's** from the **Occasions** dropdown list, which means the promotion will be available during the predefined date range from December 1 through February 28. But you don't want your actual promotion to run the entire length of the predefined date range, just until the beginning of February. You can enter the optional **Displayed start date** and **Displayed end date** to set the exact days of the promotion or you can use the ad extension scheduling from **Advanced settings**. Keep in mind, that if you set your ad extension schedule past the predefined date range of the occasion, it will stop showing at the end of the predefined date range.

- **Predefined date range. ** Each occasion has a predefined date range that determines when the promotion can be shown.
- **Display start and end dates** (optional). Once you select an occasion, you can set the display start and end dates for when the actual promotion runs.
- **Extension schedule. ** The start and end dates of when you want the extension to show.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All extension details must adhere to our [Promotion Extension policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2133732).

**Ability to set up in:** All Bing markets

**Serves in**: AU, CA, DE, FR, US and UK.

## Get to know Promotion Extensions

- Without setting the promotion's optional displayed end date, a promotion is eligible to serve until the end of its predefined range. For some occasions, the predefined range is year-round.
- The promotion will not serve past the set displayed end date.
- Promotions can still serve before the displayed start date. For example, you can provide customers a promotion code for an upcoming sale.
- You can add one minimum purchase amount and/or one promotion code.
- The promotion landing page must include details of the promotion.
