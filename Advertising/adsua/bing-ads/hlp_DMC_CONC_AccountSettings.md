# Unified Smart campaigns: Social profiles and account settings

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
## Connecting social profiles

Rather than managing all your social profiles separately, you can manage the following social profiles in one place, right here through Microsoft Advertising:

- Facebook page
- Instagram Business account
- LinkedIn company page
- Twitter account

To advertise on Facebook and Instagram through Microsoft Advertising, you need the following:

- A Facebook Ads account.
- You must be an admin for a published Facebook page.
- A payment method must be set up in Facebook.
- Currency and time zone settings in your Facebook Ads account that match the currency and time zone you want to use in Microsoft Advertising.
- The time zone and currency for both your Microsoft Advertising and Facebook Ads  accounts must be the same. If you change the time zone in your Facebook Ads account, the existing ad account will be deactivated. You will need to reconnect your Facebook Ads account and then a new Microsoft Advertising account will be created with the updated time zone. Learn how to [change the time zone of your Facebook Ads account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2113516).
- If you also want to advertise on Instagram, you must be an admin and associate your Instagram Business account to your Facebook page. [Learn more.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2110520)

## Connect a Facebook Ads account

We'll use the Facebook Ads account to bill you for all Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns that are created in Microsoft Advertising. Please note that instead of using your Facebook Ads campaigns we'll use new ad campaigns in Microsoft Advertising.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can connect your Facebook Ads account to Microsoft Advertising, you must first connect to your Facebook page. The Facebook page is where you are driving the traffic to. You can only connect one Facebook Ads account, but you can connect up to 10 Facebook pages. You can only connect a Facebook Ads account that can advertise on your Facebook pages.

1. From the **Social** page, select **Link new profile** in the left menu.
1. In the **Facebook Ads account** section of the page, select **Connect to Facebook Ads account**.
1. Select the Facebook Ads account that you want to use and select **Send access request**.
1. To continue, sign in to Facebook to verify and allow Microsoft Advertising access to your Facebook Ads account.

## Connect your social profiles

You can manage your social media across multiple channels without paying for ads.

1. From the **Social** page, select **Link new profile** in the left menu.
1. Select the social profile that you want to connect.
1. Enter your log in details and follow the steps to authorize the profile.

## Disconnect a social profile

1. In the upper-right corner of any Microsoft Advertising page, select the profile picture and then select **Settings**.
1. From the menu on the left, select **Social profiles**.
1. Under **Already connected**, find the profile that you want to remove and select **Disconnect**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your social ads for a campaign will be paused if we lose access to the associated Facebook page.
> If you disconnect a Facebook page from Microsoft Advertising, all of your ads in Microsoft Advertising campaigns that are associated with that page will be permanently removed. In addition, you won't be able to add another Facebook page to those campaigns. If you reconnect the page you can only associate it with new campaigns.
