# Manage bulk download emails

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not everyone has this feature. See [this article](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBulk.md) for more information.

When you create a bulk download, you have the option to receive an email notification when the download runs (see [this article](./hlp_BA_CONC_BulkDownload.md) for more information on bulk downloading). If it was a one-time download, you will only receive one email about it.  If it is a recurring scheduled download, and you opted to receive email notifications, you will receive an email every time it runs. To change this setting:

- From your **Accounts Summary** page, click **Bulk Operations** and then **Downloads** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Tools** &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; **Bulk edits**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**Downloads**) and look at the **Scheduled downloads** table.
- In the scheduled download's **Actions** column, click **Edit**.
- Navigate to the download's **Schedule spreadsheet download** section.
- Under **Download notification**, uncheck the **Email me when the download is complete** checkbox.
