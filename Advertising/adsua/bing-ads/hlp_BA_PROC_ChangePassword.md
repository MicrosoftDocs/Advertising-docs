# How do I change my password or user name?

This article covers how to change your password and what to do if you need to change the user name or email address that you use to sign in to Microsoft Advertising. If you’ve forgotten your password, see [I forgot my user name or password](./hlp_BA_PROC_ForgotPassword.md).

## Changing your password

The steps to change your password depend on how you are signing in to Microsoft Advertising:

- **Using a Microsoft Advertising user name**. Only customers who signed up before October 2013 and haven’t transitioned to using an email address are still signing in with a Microsoft Advertising user name.
- **Using an email address **(a Microsoft account). This is the new way to sign in to Microsoft Advertising and will be required for all Microsoft Advertising customers in the future.

1. Sign in to Microsoft Advertising.
1. [!INCLUDE [PreferencesMySettings](./includes/PreferencesMySettings.md)]
1. Next to **Password**, you will see one of two things:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col" colspan="2">Two fields to enter and confirm your new password</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight:normal;background-color:transparent;border-bottom:solid 1px #ccc" scope="row">
      <para>
          Sign in with a Microsoft Advertising user name
        </para>
    </th>
    <td>
      <para>
        <strong>And you should do this:</strong> Enter your new password, confirm your new password, and then click <strong>Save</strong>.  
          Passwords must be between 6 and 16 characters and can consist of whole numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
        </para>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col" colspan="2">
        A link to <strong>
          Edit in Microsoft account
        </strong>
      </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight:normal;background-color:transparent;border-bottom:solid 1px #ccc" scope="row">
      <para>Sign in with an email address</para>
    </th>
    <td>
      <para>
        <strong>And you should do this:</strong> Keep in mind that when you change your password for your Microsoft account, you change it for all Microsoft services and devices that you sign in to using that email address. Those services and devices can include Office365, Skype, OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, Outlook.com, etc.
        </para>
      <ul type="ORDERED">
        <li>
            Click the <strong>Edit in Microsoft account</strong> link.
          </li>
        <li>You might be required to verify your identity with a security code that is sent to you via email or text message.</li>
        <li>
            On the <strong>Security settings</strong> page, click <strong>Change your password</strong>.
          </li>
        <li>
            On the <strong>Change your password</strong> page, enter your current password, enter your new password, re-enter your new password, and then click <strong>Save</strong>.
          </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Changing your user name or email address

If you are still signing in to Microsoft Advertising with a user name, you can't change your user name, but you can transition to signing in with an email address (a Microsoft account). Signing in with an email address will be required for all Microsoft Advertising customers in the future. Find out [how to make the transition now](./hlp_BA_CONC_MSAFAQ.md).

Now, let's clarify what we mean by "changing your email address." If you are just trying to change your contact email address, the email address that Microsoft Advertising uses to send you information about your account, see [Change contact information](./hlp_BA_PROC_EditMySettings.md). If you want to change the email address that you use to sign in, you need to follow the steps below to add (or invite) yourself as a new user (using a new email address) and then delete your old user profile. If you need help with this change, you can [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371).

## Change the email address you sign in with

Only Super Admins and Standard Users can invite or delete a new user.

**Inviting a new user**

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickAccountaccessTab2](./includes/ClickAccountaccessTab2.md)]
1. From **User management**, click **Invite user**.
1. Enter your name and email address.       The email address is where we will send instructions for you to complete the invite process. It does not need to be the one that you will sign in with.
1. Select a product language, select an account role, and then choose which accounts you will have access to.
1. Click **Send**.       You will receive an email that provides instructions on signing up for Microsoft Advertising using your preferred email address.
1. Click the link in the email and do one of the following:
  - If you've sent the invitation to the email address you want to sign in with, confirm your contact information (such as the email address that you'd like to use to receive critical alerts, which can be different from your user name), agree to the Microsoft Advertising Terms and Conditions, and click **Save**.           -or-
  - If you want to sign in with a different email address or create a new one, select **sign in using a different email address**, and then select **Sign in with a different Microsoft account** in the new window. You'll be prompted to enter a different email address or to create a new one.

After you enter or create an email address, you'll be taken back to Microsoft Advertising.

**Deleting an existing user**

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickAccountaccessTab2](./includes/ClickAccountaccessTab2.md)]
1. From **User management** tab, find the tile of user you want to remove and then click **Delete**.
