# Use Microsoft Advertising Opportunities for ideas to improve your campaign

On the Opportunities page, you will see several suggestions for improving the performance of your campaign. Here's an example of what your Opportunities page might look like:

![Opportunities Home](../images/BA_ScreenCap_Opportunities.png)
You can select any of the View Opportunities buttons to see suggestions in either a Simple View, which is the default view, or an Advanced View, which gives you a more detailed, tabular way to review, apply, and dismiss opportunities. You can toggle between Simple View and Advanced View, and we'll remember your last setting.

![Opportunites Home](../images/BA_ScreenCap_OpportunitiesView.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You might not see opportunities if Microsoft Advertising doesn't have enough historical performance data to provide suggestions or your account or all of your campaigns are inactive or paused.
> Opportunities are automatically generated estimates based on historical campaign performance. The actual performance of Opportunities may vary and are not guaranteed.

These suggestions can include any or all of the following:
