# How can I compare performance by date ranges?

Want to see how your campaigns have changed over time on the Account Summary or Campaigns page without having to run reports and create pivot tables?    Period comparison reporting lets you compare two different date ranges on a page.

You can compare in three different ways. Here are examples to explain how each works:

- **Previous period:**  If you currently have this week selected as your date range, then an example of the previous period would be last week.
- **Same period last year:**  If you currently have this week selected as your date range, then the same period last year will be the current date range last year. For example, if the current period is 4/10/16-4/16/16 then the same period last year is 4/10/15-4/16/15.
- **Custom:**  You can select any other time period for comparison. This time period can be any range and any length as long as it is within the last 3 years and does not include today.

## Turn on period comparison reporting

 
1. On the **Accounts Summary** or **Campaigns** page,         click the date range (or click the date picker).
1. On the **Compare** toggle, click **OFF**.  
1. Select **Previous period**, **Same period last year**, or **Custom**, and then **Apply**.  
1. In the table, click the plus next to each performance metric to review the comparison.  
You will see the following sub columns:

   - Current Period (mm/dd/yy – mm/dd/yy)
   - Comparison Period (mm/dd/yy – mm/dd/yy)
   - Change (Current Time Period – Comparison Period)
   - Change % ((Current – Comparison)/Comparison \* 100%)

1. In the table, click the minus next to each performance metric to close the comparison.

> [!NOTE]
> You can sort, filter, and download all the sub columns and comparison data.

## Turn off period comparison reporting
