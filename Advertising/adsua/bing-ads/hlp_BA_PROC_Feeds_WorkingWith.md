# Business data feeds

There are three main types of Business data feeds: Ad customizer feeds, dynamic data feeds, and page feeds. All three can be accessed and managed by selecting **Tools** > **Business data**.

**Ad customizer feeds**  produce ads that dynamically update themselves into hundreds of variations that are targeted towards customers’ searches. Learn more about [ad customizer feeds](./hlp_BA_CONC_Feeds_AdCustomizers.md).

**Dynamic data feeds**  generate ads specific to your vertical. Available options are: [Automotive inventory](./hlp_BA_CONC_Feeds_Autos.md), [Credit cards](./hlp_BA_CONC_Feeds_CreditCards.md), Events (coming soon), Hotels and vacation rentals (coming soon), and [Tours and activities](./hlp_BA_CONC_Feeds_ToursActivities.md).

**Page feeds**  allow you to easily upload and apply custom labels to all the relevant URLs for your dynamic search ads, ensuring maximum website coverage. Learn more about [page feeds](./hlp_BA_CONC_DynamicSearchAds_PageFeeds.md).
