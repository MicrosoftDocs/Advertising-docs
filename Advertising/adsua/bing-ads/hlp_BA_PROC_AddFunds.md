# Add funds to a prepay account

If you have a prepay account,  you need to add funds to your account before your ads can display on Microsoft Advertising. You can manually add money to your account at any time, or you can set up automatic payments (auto-recharge) to make sure there is no gap in your online advertising. If you don't set up auto-recharge and your account balance hits zero, we'll pause your campaigns and your ads will not display until you add more funds.

The maximum amount of money you can add to your account depends on the country of your billing address and the payment method you are using to fund your account. You'll see the maximum amount allowed when you add your payment.

Funding a prepay account can be immediate or can take up to 3 weeks, depending on your payment method. (For the complete list of payment methods available to you, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).)

|Payment method|Processing time|
|---|---|
|Credit/debit card|Typically instant, but can take up to 24 hours if there are system delays with card processing|
|PayPal|Typically instant|
|Bank transfer|Up to 5 days|
|SEPA Direct Debit|Up to 5 business days for a first payment, and up to 2 business days for subsequent payments|
|Check|1-3 weeks, including mailing time|

If you need to add a new credit card to your account, be sure to read [Paying by credit and debit card](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md). And if you want to review whether a prepay account or a postpay threshold account works best for your needs, see [What are my billing options? Pay now or pay later](./hlp_BA_CONC_HowBillingWorks.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are [required to pay taxes on your advertising charges](./hlp_BA_CONC_TaxVATInfo.md). We'll deduct any taxes due from the amount of your payment. You can estimate the amount of taxes due and the amount that will go toward your account balance when you add funds.
