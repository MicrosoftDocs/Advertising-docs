# Auto-generated remarketing lists

[!INCLUDE [OpenBeta](./includes/OpenBeta.md)]
> [!NOTE]
> All Visitors lists and All Converters lists are available in our global markets, while Smart Remarketing lists are currently limited to our US market.

Auto-generated remarketing lists are those that Microsoft Advertising creates automatically for you. These lists help you re-engage with people who are most likely to convert. There are three types of auto-generated remarketing lists:
- **All Visitors** . People who have visited your website in the past 30 days.
- **All Converters** . People who have converted in the past 180 days.
- **Smart Remarketing** . People who are likely to convert. Smart Remarketing is powered by Microsoft Advertisingâ€™s audience intelligence and designed to deliver a higher conversion rate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have a Universal Event Tracking (UET) tag to use any auto-generated remarketing list type. For All Converters and Smart Remarketing lists, you must also have active conversion goals in place. Learn more about [Universal Event Tracking]( hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2WhatIsTag) and [ conversion goals](./hlp_BA_CONC_UETv2CTGoalType.md).
