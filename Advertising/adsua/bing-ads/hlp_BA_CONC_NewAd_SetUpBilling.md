# Setting up your billing

Before your campaigns can go live and your ads run, you need to make some choices about how you are billed. If you create ad campaigns for your own business, it’s more common to set up postpay threshold accounts, which means you pay for clicks after charges add up and not ahead of time. For other billing options, including prepay and monthly invoice, see [What are my billing options? Pay now or pay later](./hlp_BA_CONC_HowBillingWorks.md).

## How postpay threshold accounts work

With postpay threshold accounts, Microsoft Advertising automatically bills you on your monthly billing date (the date of the month you signed up) or when your charges reach a specific amount, whichever comes first. This predetermined amount, called your billing threshold, is the credit limit of your account. As you make payments, your billing threshold will increase. Read more [about billing threshold](./hlp_BA_CONC_BillingThreshold.md).
