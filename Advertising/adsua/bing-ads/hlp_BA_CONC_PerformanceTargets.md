# Understanding and setting performance targets

The Performance Targets can give you valuable insight into campaign performance trends and alerts you to items that may need extra or even critical attention. Once you create and set your performance targets, Microsoft Advertising can help you visualize whether you’re on track to meet them. If it looks like you won’t reach the targets you set, you can consider adjusting your campaign’s settings to improve performance.

A performance target has three sections:

**Target details:**    Determine whether you’re on track to meet your goals by comparing your targets to performance data.

**Target history:**    Review a collection of past performance targets.

**Settings:**    Identify the targets that are off track and leverage the target details to make the necessary adjustments to your campaigns.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep checking your performance targets as they may continue to change based on the adjustments you make to your campaigns.

## How do I create a performance target?
1. Click the **Campaigns** tab, and, on the left pane, click the **Performance Targets** (or from the main menu on the far left, click **All campaigns** and from the page menu, click **Performance target**).
1. Click **Create performance target**.
1. Enter a unique name for your performance target.
1. Select one or more campaigns that you want to apply to your performance target.
