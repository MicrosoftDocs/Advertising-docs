# About broad match

Broad match is a [keyword match type](./hlp_BA_CONC_MatchOptions.md). It makes your ad eligible to be displayed when a search query or other input includes either the individual words in your keyword in **any** order, or words **related** to your keyword.

## How broad match can help you

- **Spend less time building keyword lists**. Trying to figure out seemingly endless variations of keywords is time consuming. With broad match, Microsoft Advertising does the work for you! This way, you don’t have to worry about creating keyword lists to try to cover all relevant searches.
- **Spend money on keywords that work**. Not all keyword variations will lead to clicks for your ads, so Microsoft Advertising will stop showing your ads for those specific keyword variations. Doing so will allow you to focus on the keywords that do work and not accrue click charges for keyword variations that don’t. We are constantly working to improve our broad match functionality to make sure your ads are shown only on relevant terms.

## Examples of broad match at work

Keep in mind that there will be times when different options might be more helpful. For example:

- If you find that some of your broad match keywords are matching on search terms that aren't relevant to your business, you can use [negative keywords](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutNegativeKeywords.md) to fine-tune or restrict how the broad match is being applied.
- If you are interested in improving your click-through rate (CTR), consider using exact and phrase match. While this means that your ads will show far less often than if you used broad match, having a higher CTR means that your ads are being more precisely targeted.

- Preferring short keywords over long keywords can also improve the quality of your matches when using broad match.
- Your quality score shows you how competitive your ads are in the marketplace. A low quality score means that your competitors’ campaigns are performing better than yours – in other words, their ads are probably showing more often and more prominently on the search results page.
