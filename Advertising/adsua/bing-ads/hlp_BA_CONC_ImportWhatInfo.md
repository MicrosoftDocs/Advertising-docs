# What gets imported from Google Ads

Now that you’ve imported your campaigns from Google Ads, you can check the status of your import, review error logs, and edit, pause, or delete your import schedule. Keep in mind that not all information will be imported, but that doesn’t mean it’s not supported within Microsoft Advertising. So, after you import, be sure to review your campaigns to make sure everything is good to go and add the missing information back to your campaigns.

## Items you should check during import

Some specific situations require special attention during import. If you are importing any of the items below, make sure to review the following information.

## Ad distribution (Network)
Ad distribution is where you want your ads to show. When a Google Ads ad group is imported, it is mapped in the following ways:

- If the network is the **Search and Display Network**, we set it to **Search**.
- If the network is the **Google Search Network**, we set it to **Search**.

To learn more, see [About ad distribution](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdDistribution.md).
> [!NOTE]
> If the network is the **Google Search Network**, and **Include search partners** is selected, then Bing will target all search networks. (Bing, AOL, and Yahoo search and syndicated search partners)
> Syndicated search is only available in certain countries. To learn more, see [What is the search network?](./hlp_BA_CONC_SearchNetContentNet.md).
> Microsoft Advertising stopped serving ads on the content network.

## Age and gender targeting
By importing your age and gender targeting, you can reach customers who’re likely to be within the demographic range you choose. Microsoft Advertising matches most of your Google Ads age and gender targets, however, there are a few differences that you can review in the tables below.

## Audience targeting
Audiences are groups of potential customers that you can target. By importing your audiences from Google Ads, you can boost your campaign performance by reaching people browsing your website through Bing.

## Audience targeting: FAQ

## Which audience types can I import from Google Ads?
> [!NOTE]
> - Audience lists created at the MCC level. List types must belong to the account you’re importing from.
> - Automatically created lists
> - Lists set to match every rule group
> - Remarketing list created in Google Analytics

Below are lists without those attributes.

## What happens when I import an individual in-market audience that doesn’t exist in Microsoft Advertising?
When you import a specific in-market audience that doesn’t exist in Microsoft Advertising, all its associations are mapped to its parent audience. For example, let’s say you want to import an ad group or campaign with one audience, “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bow ties.” Since “Bow ties” is not supported by Microsoft Advertising, all associations with “Bowties” would be mapped to its parent audience, “Apparel &amp; Accessories,” instead.
## What happens when I import multiple in-market audiences?
When you import multiple associations that are mapped to the same in-market audience, only associations with the **direct** audience are imported. For example, let’s say you want to import an ad group or campaign with two audience associations:

- The first association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories.”
- The second association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bow ties.”

Only the ad group or campaign's first association will be imported because it can be mapped directly to the audience, “Apparel &amp; Accessories.” The ad group or campaign's other association will not be imported.

## Importing multiple in-market audiences with no direct associations

When you import multiple associations that are mapped to the same in-market audience, and there are **no** direct associations available, then only the association that is active **and** has the highest bid boost will be imported and mapped to its parent audience. For example, let’s say you want to import an ad group or campaign with three audience associations, all of which are not available in Microsoft Advertising:

- The first association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bow ties,” is active, and has a 20% bid boost.
- The second association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Belts,” is active, and has a 10% bid boost.
- The third association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bracelets,” is paused, and has a 30% bid boost.

Only the ad group or campaign's first association will be imported because out of all the active associations, it has the highest bid boost. The ad group or campaign's other two associations will not be imported.

## What happens when I import multiple in-market audiences with no direct associations?
When you import multiple associations that are mapped to the same in-market audience, and there are **no** direct associations available, then only the association that is active **and** has the highest bid boost will be imported and mapped to its parent audience. For example, let’s say you want to import an ad group or campaign with three audience associations, all of which are not available in Microsoft Advertising:

- The first association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bow ties,” is active, and has a 20% bid boost.
- The second association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Belts,” is active, and has a 10% bid boost.
- The third association is with “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bracelets,” is paused, and has a 30% bid boost.

Only the ad group or campaign's first association will be imported because out of all the active associations, it has the highest bid boost. The ad group or campaign's other two associations will not be imported.

## How do I know which in-market audience associations were mapped to their parent audiences?
After your import completes, you can see in-market audience associations and their parent audiences under **Import Summary** on the **Import Campaigns** page. Please note that if there were any issues with the import, the **Logs** table will include an error file to review, as well as the settings that were in effect at the time of the import.
## What happens to existing in-market associations if an audience becomes available in Microsoft Advertising?
When a Google Ads audience becomes available in Microsoft Advertising, we will update its associations automatically when you re-import. For example, let’s say you have an ad group in Google Ads associated with the audience “Apparel &amp; Accessories/Bow ties.” Since “Bow ties” is an audience not yet supported by Bing, its associations will be mapped to its parent audience, “Apparel &amp; Accessories.” However, when “Bow ties” becomes available, Microsoft Advertising will delete the existing association, “Apparel &amp; Accessories” and create a new association, “Apparel &amp; Accessories/ Bow ties.”
## How do I associate a UET tag?
A Universal Event Tracking (UET) tag records what customers do on your website and sends that information to Microsoft Advertising. If you’re importing remarketing lists or other audiences, you’ll need to associate a specific UET tag with each. If you don’t have a UET tag in Microsoft Advertising yet, we will create one for you if you select this option.

1. When customizing import options, under UET tag, select **Associate the following UET tag with any remarketing list, audience, or conversion goal that has not previously imported into Microsoft Advertising**.
1. Select an existing UET tag or create a new tag.
1. If you are creating a tag, enter the **Tag name** and **Tag description**.

> [!NOTE]
> Campaign-level associations will only be imported for search network campaigns.
> If any ad group-level associations already exists for a particular campaign in Microsoft Advertising, its campaign-level associations will not be imported from Google Ads.

## Bids and budgets
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the import option **Update bids and bid strategies** is now split into **Update bids** and **Update bid strategies**. Even with this change, your original bid settings will remain the same. You can review the **Bids and budgets** section of your import options to customize your settings at anytime.

Both Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads offer you the ability to limit your campaign spend on a daily basis.

Microsoft Advertising has different minimum bid and budget requirements than Google Ads. To help you import all of your data quickly, any bids or budgets that are too low will be raised to meet our minimums. These minimums can be found in the table below. Keep in the mind that while you can opt out of these increases during the import setup, the campaigns that don’t meet these minimums won’t get imported.

## Currency mismatch

If the currencies you set for your Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising account do not match, you can either convert your currency data to match Microsoft Advertising, or opt out. If you choose to opt out, you can manually adjust your bids and budgets using the import options or after your import is complete. If you set up an account and need to [change the currency](./hlp_BA_CONC_Currency.md), you will need to set up a new account. If you have campaigns, ad groups, ads, and settings in the old account, then you will want to export them from the old account and import them into the new one.

## Bid strategies
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the import option **Update bids and bid strategies** is now split into **Update bids** and **Update bid strategies**. All new and scheduled imports have the **Update bid strategies** option enabled by default. To opt out, uncheck **Update bid strategies** under **Bids and budgets** in your import options.

Some bid strategies are not supported in Microsoft Advertising. For unsupported bid strategies, your campaign bid strategy will be set to Enhanced CPC and bids will be set to an amount we recommend. Please note that you can update these bids after you import them to Microsoft Advertising.

## Device targeting
> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the import option **Do not import negative bid modifier for desktop (except -100%)** is only available to customers using the new simplified import worflow.

Without the simplified import workflow we will import all of your negative bid modifiers from Google Ads. With the simplified import worflow if you don't choose customizations we will not import negative bid modifiers for desktop targets (except modifiers set to -100%). Using -100% effectively opts you out of displaying your ads on desktops. You can choose customizations to change the default option and import negative bid modifiers.

## Dynamic search ads
> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.

[Dynamic search ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_DynamicSearchAds.md) provide a streamlined, low-touch way to make sure customers searching on the Microsoft Search Network find your products or services.

Mixed mode campaigns from Google Ads are campaigns that contain both dynamic search ads and other types (e.g., Expanded Text Ads). If you’re in a market where dynamic search ads are not yet supported by Microsoft Advertising we will only import other ad types into **Standard** ad groups. Once dynamic search ads are available in your market, we will import dynamic search ads into **Dynamic** ad groups and other ad types into **Standard** ad groups. Both ad group types will be created in search campaigns.

If you import dynamic search ads containing display URL paths that exceed 15 characters, the paths will be dropped. The rest of the ad, including the URL without the excessive paths, will stay the same.

## Language targeting
## Campaign and ad group languages

Targeting multiple languages allows you to have different ad groups in the same campaign show ads on websites in different languages. During an import, campaign languages are set to the Google Ads’ target languages that we support and ad group languages are automatically set to **Use the campaign settings**.

Microsoft Advertising supports the following ad languages:

[!INCLUDE [AvailableAdLanguages](./includes/AvailableAdLanguages.md)]
If you’d like to opt out of target language updates during a re-import, simply uncheck **Campaign and ad group languages** in your import options.  Please note that if you import target languages from Google Ads but your Microsoft Advertising campaigns don’t have any, all supported targeted languages will still be imported regardless of whether or not you opted out of target language updates. If we don't support any of the targeted languages you imported from Google Ads, your campaign will not import and be flagged with the error message: “Unsupported target languages.”

## Location targeting
When you import your Google Ads campaigns, we take the imported location targets and automatically match them to the same location targets in Microsoft Advertising. However, there may be location targets (such as smaller cities) in Google Ads that we don't support. When this happens, we automatically expand the target so that it can be mapped to a nearby locale (such as a state, region, or a province) per Google Ads geographic data. If both the focused and expanded location targets are unsupported by Microsoft Advertising, neither will be imported.

For example, let’s say you have a campaign in Google Ads whose location target is set to an unsupported city A in the state/region/province B. In this scenario, we will automatically map it to the supported parent location, state/region/province B. If both city A and state/region/province B are unsupported by Microsoft Advertising, neither location targets will be imported.

## Opt out of expanding your location targets

1. Click **Import Campaigns** at the top of the page.
1. Select **Import from Google Ads**.
1. Click **Sign into Google**.
1. Select the Google Ads campaign you want to import, then click **Continue**.
1. Under **Choose Import Options**, select **Do not expand unsupported location targets**.

Please note that by selecting this option, unsupported location targets will not be imported, however, your campaigns will continue to serve worldwide without location targeting.

## Pause campaigns containing only unsupported location targets immediately after importing

1. Click **Import Campaigns** at the top of the page.
1. Select **Import from Google Ads**.
1. Click **Sign into Google**.
1. Select the Google Ads campaign you want to import, then click **Continue**.
1. Under **Choose Import Options**, select **Pause campaigns when all imported location targets are unsupported**.

Please note that if you select this option, and a campaign contains both supported **and** unsupported location targets, the campaign will not be paused, and supported location targets will continue to serve.

## Review your imported location targets

You can review all your imported location targets in the Import Summary, including which unsupported location targets were mapped to a supported parent location. If you have any items with issues from importing, you can download your import errors to a spreadsheet. Each unsupported location target that gets mapped to a parent location target will be indicated with a warning in the downloaded spreadsheet. You can then decide to keep the supported location target, update the location target, or delete it all together.
## Negative keyword lists
You can use negative keywords or keyword phrases to help prevent your ad from being displayed when a search query or other input contains your keywords but is irrelevant to your landing page content. With a shared negative keyword list, you can apply entire lists of negative keywords to multiple campaigns and make changes across campaigns by editing a single list. When the checkbox next to **Negative keyword list** under **Choose Import Options** is selected, the following will occur:
- All negative keyword lists from Google Ads will be imported. Negative keyword lists with identical names in Microsoft Advertising will be updated.
- Negative keywords from both Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads will be merged.
- Microsoft Advertising associations will be overwritten by any current Google Ads associations.

## Shopping campaigns
Before you import your Google shopping campaigns into Microsoft Advertising Shopping Campaigns, make sure to create a Microsoft Merchant Center store. Then, when you import, you must link your store to the incoming shopping campaign.

If you will be using an existing Google catalog, make sure the catalog has valid data in the **Country of sale** field. Microsoft Advertising supports the following countries for this field:
- Australia
- Austria
- Belgium
- Canada
- Denmark
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- India
- Ireland
- Italy
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Spain
- Switzerland
- Sweden
- United Kingdom
- United States

## URL Tracking
URL tracking allows you to find out how people got to your website by adding tracking parameters in Microsoft Advertising and then using a third-party tracking tool or service to analyze the data. You should check tracking templates, custom parameters, final URL suffix, utm_source, and other settings to ensure accurate reporting.

If your Google Ads campaign uses the utm_source parameter, the value for that parameter is likely "Google," "GoogleAds," or a close variant such as "googleshopping" or "GoogleAdsIndia." These values will be replaced by "bing." For example, **http://www.example.com/?utm_source=google** will be imported as **http://www.example.com/?utm_source=bing**.

## Items that can’t be imported but can be re-created using Microsoft Advertising

- Account-level App Extensions
- Ad group-level App Extensions
- Automated rules
- IP exclusions

> [!NOTE]
> - 20 thousand campaigns
> - 10 million ad groups
> - 20 million keywords
> - 20 million ads
> - 5.5 million ad group-level and campaign-level negative keywords combined
> - 10 million ad group product partitions
> - 200,000 all other entities combined
> - 3 million targets

## Detailed list of imported and updated items

Whether this is your first time or you’re re-importing an existing campaign, it’s important to keep track of all the items that are either transferred or updated, and which ones are simply left untouched. To make it easier for you,  please refer to the list below to see which items get brought over during your initial import as well as which items Microsoft Advertising updates when you repeat the process.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the list below is not a comprehensive list of imported items. Microsoft Advertising imports all the data needed to manage your campaigns and aims to provide the best experience for you.

However, if you import a campaign named “Coffee Sales” under a campaign that already contains an ad group named “coffee sales”, we recognize them as the same, and will update accordingly.
