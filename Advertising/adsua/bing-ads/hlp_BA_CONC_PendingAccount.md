# Why is my account pending?

Your account may be pending for one of two reasons:

If you're an established customer who has previously run ads and now have your account in pending status, then you need to [add a payment method](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md). Once you add a payment method, your account will become active.

If you're a new Microsoft Advertising customer, your account will remain in pending status until you've completed the following setup items:

   - Chosen whether you [pay now or pay later](./hlp_BA_CONC_HowBillingWorks.md).
   - [Added a payment method](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md).
   - [Created your first campaign and ad](./hlp_BA_PROC_Create1stAd.md).

You'll be up and running within 10 minutes of completing setup. If not, please contact [Microsoft Advertising support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) for further assistance.
