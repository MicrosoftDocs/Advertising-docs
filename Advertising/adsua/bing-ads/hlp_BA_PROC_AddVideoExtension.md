# Video Extensions: Express your brand identity

Video Extensions are an interactive way to demonstrate products, services, and brand messages. They can showcase special deals, emotions, ambiance, culture, and action. Combined with other extensions, Video Extensions create a richer experience that stands out more than just images and words.

On desktop, when a user clicks on your thumbnail image, your video plays in a full-screen overlay above the **Display text** and **Action text**. Viewers can watch the video, and then click on the call-to-action button or the text in your ad. On mobile, the video plays in the frame with the **Display text**. The thumbnail image provides an opportunity to engage viewers and generate views. Video extensions operate best when they complement your ad with unique content rather than repeating what users can already read in the text.

## Best practices to create a successful Video Extension

- Campaigns and ad groups associated with Video Extensions should have at least two other below-snippet decorations, such as Call Out, Structured Snippet, Filter Link, Dynamic Callouts, Dynamic Structured Snippet, etc. This allows for enough room within the ad to create space for the Video Extension thumbnail.
- Pair your video extension with a campaign or ad group that has ad descriptions of less than 82 characters (a short ad description is necessary to make space for the thumbnail in the ad).
- We don’t recommend using Action, Image, or Call extensions with campaigns/ad groups associated with Video Extensions because the video competes with them for space.
- Your video’s content and message should be distinct from the ad description and other extensions.
- The landing page of the video should allow users to act rather than only receive information about your offer.
- We recommend using captions on your video.

## Get to know Video Extensions

- Video extensions are only served on high-quality ads with relevant action type.
- The cost of a click to play a video is the same as the cost of a click to your website.
- Only the first click on an ad with a video extension is charged; all subsequent clicks by the same user on the same ad are free. For example, if a user clicks to play the video and then clicks on the **Action text** button, the advertiser will only be charged once.
- A thumbnail image is required. We recommend using an engaging image that will encourage clicks to view your video.
