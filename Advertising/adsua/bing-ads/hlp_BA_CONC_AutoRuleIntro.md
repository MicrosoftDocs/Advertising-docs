# Save time by automating your campaign

Although your campaign will always require some monitoring, there are many tasks you can have Microsoft Advertising do for you automatically. Here are a couple examples of how you can use automated rules:

- Start and stop your campaigns for special events, such as a Black Friday or New Year's Day sale.
- Increase your budget for campaigns that are getting lots of clicks and conversions. Similarly, you can automatically decrease your budget for campaigns that are costing you too much based on their average cost per click (CPC).

You can create automated rules in just a few steps:
1. From the collapsible menu on the left, select **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, select either **Ad groups**, **Ads &amp; extensions**, or **Keywords**.
1. Select the checkbox next to your chosen ad group, ad, or keyword.
1. Select **Automate**.
1. Select what you want to happen (for example, **Pause campaigns when...**).
1. Optional: Specify the circumstances that you want to trigger your action (for example, CPC > $5.00). You can set up to five such triggers for each rule.
1. Specify how often you want the rule to run.
1. Choose if you want an email sent to you when the rule is run.
1. Optional: If you want to see a preview of what would happen if the rule were run immediately, select **Preview**.
For example, if you create a rule to automatically increase your budget based on CTR, you can use **Preview** to see which budgets would change and by how much.

1. Select **Save**.

There are many other scenarios for using automated rules. [Here are more examples](./hlp_BA_CONC_AutoRuleExamples.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword bid automated rules and [bid adjustments](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md) work independently of each other. If the criteria for both are met on a keyword bid, then both will be applied.
