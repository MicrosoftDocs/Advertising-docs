# Troubleshooting promotional offers (coupons)

Promotional offers are a great way for new customers to try out Microsoft Advertising. If you haven’t added your promotional code, here are instructions on [how to redeem your promotional offer](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutPromoOffers.md). If you added your promotional code and are seeing a message that indicates there is an issue, read more about the issue below.

## Before you can redeem a promotional offer, add a payment method.
Before you can redeem your promotional offer, you need to have a payment method associated with your account. Promotional offers are intended for customers who are interested in running ads on Microsoft Advertising. Having a payment method indicates that interest, and it also gives customers a way to pay once the promotional balance is depleted.

## Before you can redeem a promotional offer, set your payment method as primary.
If you have a payment method, but it has not been set as primary, you won’t be able to redeem your promotional code.

To set your payment method as primary:

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Select the **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. Next to a payment method, select **Set as primary**.

After you use up your promotional amount, we will charge your primary payment method (postpay account) or deduct funds (prepay account) to cover the cost of your clicks.

## We don't recognize your promotional code. Please check to make sure you entered it correctly.
Check the promotional offer again and make sure that you enter the code exactly as it appears.

## This promotional offer has expired and cannot be redeemed.
Each promotional offer has an expiration date. Check the details of your promotional offer for the start and expiration dates.

## This promotional offer has already been used.
Promotional offers can only be used once, and this promotional offer has already been redeemed.

## You've already redeemed a new customer promotion. Unfortunately, we only offer one per customer.

Keep in mind that if there are multiple users accessing this account, another user might have redeemed the promotional offer.
