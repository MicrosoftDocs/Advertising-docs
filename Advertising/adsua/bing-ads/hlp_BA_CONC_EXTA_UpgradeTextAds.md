# Why should I update standard text ads to Expanded Text Ads?

Expanded Text Ads are a new, mobile-optimized ad format that enables you to craft longer ad copy and optimize your ad text to better engage with potential customers before they click on your ads. Expanded Text Ads work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, giving you a way to create more compelling calls to action for consumers and drive higher conversions to your business.

## What's the difference between standard text ads and Expanded Text Ads?

Here's how Expanded Text Ads compare to standard text ads:

|Ad part|Standard text ads|Expanded Text Ads|
|---|---|---|
|Ad title|25 characters|90 characters: Supports three headlines, up to 30 characters each, separated by a space, vertical bar, and space (" | ")|
|Ad text|71 characters|180 characters: Supports two descriptions, up to two 90 characters each|
|Display URL|35 characters, manually entered and error-prone|Domain and subdomain automatically generated from your final URL (preserving capitalization) plus two customizable URL paths|

## How do I turn a standard text ad into an Expanded Text Ad?
1. From the **Ads** tab, select a standard text ad and then click **Edit** (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** > **Ad groups**. Then, click **Ads &amp; extensions**. Select a standard text ad and then click **Edit**).
1. We prepopulate the Expanded Text Ad fields with information from the standard text ad. Review and take the opportunity to expand upon the following:
   1. Enter your landing page URL in the **Final URL** box. If you use destination URL tracking, you will need to upgrade to an Upgraded URL: Copy the landing page portion of your destination URL and paste it into the **Final URL** box, and copy the tracking portion of your destination URL and paste it into the **Tracking template** box (under **Ad URL options**). For more information, check out [What are Upgraded URLs and how do I upgrade?](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_MigrateFAQ.md)
**Note** : Your final URL — including prefix (e.g., "www."), suffix (e.g., ".com"), and any [tracking templates](./hlp_BA_CONC_GoogleAnalytics.md)&nbsp;— must be no longer than 2048 characters. However, your final URL **domain** (everything in your final URL before the first slash or tracking template) must be no longer than 67 characters.

   1. Unlike standard text ads, you can have three parts of your ad title, each up to 30 characters long. The third title is optional.
   1. Unlike standard text ads, you can have two parts of your description, each up to 90 characters long. The second description is optional.
   1. Similarly, you can also enter two parts of the URL path customers will see in your ad. Note: We pre-populate these paths if you have similar information in your display URL.
