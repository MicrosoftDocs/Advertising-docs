# I'm having trouble adding a credit card or debit card

[!INCLUDE [UserRole](./includes/UserRole.md)]
Adding credit cards to Microsoft Advertising is easy and safe, but if you run into problems, take a look at the tips below.

 
## The credit card was added but has not been set as your primary payment method for this account.
[!INCLUDE [Redesign](./includes/Redesign.md)]
To make sure that your credit card is set (assigned to your account):

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Click **Payment Methods** from the main menu.
1. If you do not have a payment method that is marked "primary," then click **set as primary** next to the payment method you want to           use to pay your charges.           **Note:** You cannot assign the primary payment method if you are not the bill-to party. In this case, you will need to work with the bill-to party to set the primary payment method.

Once you have associated a valid credit card with your account, your ads will be eligible to run.

## You have created a prepay account, but you have not funded it or the funds have not been posted to your account.
If this is a prepay account,          you need to [add funds to your account](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddFunds.md) before it becomes active. After you add funds, you should see the amount you added reflected in your "total balance" on the Billing summary page. Credit card approval should happen right away, but in some cases, it can take up to 24 hours due to system delays with card processing. Once your account has no errors, your ads will be eligible to run.

If 24 hours have passed and your account still has errors, you should [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371).

## The information that you have entered into Microsoft Advertising doesn't precisely match the information on file with your credit card company.
Here are five common problems with entering credit card info:

- Enter your name precisely as it appears on the card. Only include your middle initial if it appears on your card.
- If this is a company card, enter the company name as both a first name and last name. For example, if the company name is "Contoso Shoes,"          split the company name into the first and last name fields.
- If the company only has one name, for example, "Contoso," enter the company name in both the first and last name fields.
- If your address exceeds the Address 1 field, use the Address 2 field. Do not shorten or abbreviate your address.
- The card number and type cannot be edited, so if you make a mistake, you'll need to add a new one with the correct information. Other [credit card information can be edited](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md), such as billing address and expiration date.

## The card number was entered with dashes or spaces.
Enter the credit card number without spaces or punctuation.

## The credit card you are trying to use requires you to enter a PIN/security verification when making a payment.
Microsoft Advertising doesn't accept cards that require you to enter a PIN/security verification when making a payment. [Use a different credit card or form of payment](./hlp_BA_PROC_Account_AssociateCCard.md).

## The card you are trying to use is a prepaid card.
Prepaid cards can only be used to fund prepay accounts anywhere, except India. If your Microsoft Advertising account is based in India or you're trying to settle postpay threshold charges, please [use a different credit card or form of payment](./hlp_BA_PROC_Account_AssociateCCard.md).

## The credit card is from Brazil or India, which have additional currency requirements.
If you are using a credit card from any of these countries, your account must be in the same currency as the card. For example, a credit card with a       Brazilian billing address can only be used for accounts that have the Brazilian real as the currency.

## You did not enter all four digits of the American Express credit card security code.
American Express cards require a four-digit security code, which is printed on the front of the card. Make sure you include all four digits on the front of the       American Express card, even if the first digit is 0.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Advertising only accepts American Express cards in these currencies: US dollar, British pound, Euro, Singapore dollar, and Swiss franc.

## You are trying to enter a credit card into an inactive account
Inactive accounts cannot be reactivated if they are associated with an expired or otherwise invalid payment method or if the account has had too many declined payments.       If your account is inactive, you need to select another account or create a new account and then enter your credit card information.

## You have an account based in India and are trying to use a debit card.
Microsoft Advertising does not accept debit cards in India. Also, for accounts based in India, verification of credit card information is required. For more information, see the India section in [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).

## You are trying to use a card that is not authorized for online purchases or automatic billing.
Contact your credit card company to make sure you’re authorized to use this card for online purchases and automatic billing.

## The credit card has expired, has been reported lost or stolen, has reached its transaction limit, or is new and hasn't been activated.
In any of these situations, you'll need to contact your credit card company.

## Multi-factor authentication was required, but has failed.
Your bank might require multi-factor authentication to help prevent online fraud and unauthorized access to your account. If the one-time passcode didn't work, try resending the code or adding the card again. If this doesn't resolve the issue, please contact your bank to validate your information.
