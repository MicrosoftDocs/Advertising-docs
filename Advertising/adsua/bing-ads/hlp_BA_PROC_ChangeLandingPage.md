# Send your customers to a specific landing page

Sending customers to landing pages specific to the product or service that are most relevant to the search queries or other input can help boost click-through rate, conversions, and conversion rate. You do this by associating appropriate URLs with specific keywords.

For example, if you sell shoes and you're bidding on the keyword **running shoes**, you can "link" a URL for the webpage where you sell running shoes to that keyword. When a customer searches for running shoes and your ad is displayed, it will include the URL you've linked with the keyword.

1. Click **Campaigns** at the top of the page (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** > **Campaign**).
1. Click the **Keywords** tab.
1. Find the keyword you want to update.
1. In the **Landing page** column, click the small pen icon and enter the landing page URL.       Use the format *http://www.contoso.com* or *http://www.contoso.com/page*       This will replace the default landing page URL created for the ad.
1. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign a unique landing page URL for a match type of a keyword youâ€™ve bid on, such as **exact**. For customers whose search phrases are not exact match types, such as **children's running shoes** (phrase match) for the example above, your ad has your default landing page URL. Customers who search for a phrase that's an exact match will see an ad with a landing page URL that leads directly to your "Running Shoes" page.
> If the **Landing page** column is not displayed in the table, click **Columns** and select **Landing page**. Then click **OK**.
