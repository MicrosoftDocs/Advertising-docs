# Send your customers to a specific landing page

Sending customers to landing pages specific to the product or service that are most relevant to their search queries or other input can help boost click-through rate, conversions, and conversion rate. You do this by associating appropriate URLs with specific keywords.

For example, if you sell shoes and you're bidding on the keyword **running shoes**, you can "link" a URL for the webpage where you sell running shoes to that keyword. When a customer searches for running shoes and your ad is displayed, it will include the URL you've linked to the keyword.

1. [!INCLUDE [CampaignsCampaigns](./includes/CampaignsCampaigns.md)]
1. From the menu on the left, select **Keywords**.
1. Find and select the keyword you want to update.
1. From the menu above the table, select **Edit** > **Change landing page URLs**.
1. Input your desired URL.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign a unique landing page URL for a match type of a keyword youâ€™ve bid on, such as **exact**. For customers whose search phrases are not exact match types, such as **children's running shoes** (phrase match) for the example above, your ad has your default landing page URL. Customers who search for a phrase that's an exact match will see an ad with a landing page URL that leads directly to your "Running Shoes" page.
