# Find relevant keywords using  Microsoft Advertising tools

Three tools are available to help you find the most relevant keywords for your audience and select an appropriate bid to get your ads seen. The data these tools provide is based on historical performance from Microsoft Advertising. For even more help, take a look at [What are keywords and how should I build my keyword list?](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutKW.md)

The data from these tools can help you select and bid on keywords, but it does not predict or guarantee your results.
