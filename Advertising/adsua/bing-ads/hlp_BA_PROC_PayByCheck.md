# Paying by check or bank transfer

Microsoft Advertising accepts check and bank transfer payments on a limited basis. Generally, you can fund your prepay account via check or bank transfer. If you have a monthly invoice account, you must pay your charges via bank transfer. Your country/region, currency, and payment setting determine whether you can pay by check or bank transfer.

**Please note:** Checks and bank transfers aren't accepted for postpay threshold accounts. You'll need to pay for Microsoft Advertising with [another available payment method](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md). Also, only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)

## Detailed banking information
Select the country/region of your business address and then your currency to find relevant check and bank information.

## Paying your monthly invoice
Your invoice contains remittance instructions, the due date (net terms), and the specific customer service contact if you have questions.

**Important:**  To speed up payment processing, you must include your invoice number and account number with your payment. Without this information, payment processing time can be greatly increased beyond our typical 5 days.
