# Paying by check or bank transfer

Microsoft Advertising accepts check and bank transfer payments on a limited basis. Generally, you can fund your prepay account with a check or bank transfer. If you have a monthly invoice account, you must pay your charges via bank transfer. Your country/region, currency, and payment setting determine whether you can pay by check or bank transfer.

> [!NOTE]
> Checks and bank transfers aren't accepted for postpay threshold accounts. You'll need to pay for Microsoft Advertising with [another available payment method](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md).
> Only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)
