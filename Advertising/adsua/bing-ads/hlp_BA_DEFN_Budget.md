# Budget - Definition

## What it is

When you create a Microsoft Advertising campaign, one of the first things you have to do is set a budget. Your budget tells Microsoft Advertising the limit you want to spend per day on your campaign. When you reach your budget, Microsoft Advertising will stop displaying your ads until the next day.

## Why it's important

Your budget helps keep your online advertising costs under control. By carefully selecting the correct budget amount, you spend only as much as you want to.

## An example

If you don't want to spend more than $50 per day on your Microsoft Advertising campaign, simply set your daily budget amount to $50. Once your reach $50 in clicks, Microsoft Advertising will stop displaying your ads until the next day.

## What else you should know

- You can change your budget at any time. Feel free to experiment to find the settings that work best for you.
- Each campaign has a separate budget.
- Microsoft Advertising provides two different budget types. Make sure to take a look at [the article](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutBudgetType.md) linked below to help you choose the best one for you.
