# Understand your ad group status

Your ad group status tells you if your ad group, including all ads and keywords within that ad group, is active or not. Keep in mind that ad group status is different from campaign, ad, and keyword statuses. Ad groups fall within campaigns, and within each ad group, there are ads, keywords, and bids. Pausing an ad group also pauses all of the ads and keywords within that ad group. If you want to pause all ad groups, ads, and keywords within a campaign, simply pause the entire campaign.

## Check your ad group's status
1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Ad Groups** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Ad groups**).
1. Check the statuses of individual items in the **Delivery** column.
1. Click the **Delivery** header to sort the ad groups by status.
