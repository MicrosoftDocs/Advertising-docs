# Use Credit card ads to showcase your products and promotions

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Showcase your credit card products and promotions, such as rewards and cash back percent. [!INCLUDE [NoCrawl](./includes/NoCrawl.md)] Instead, Credit card ads are dynamically generated based on the data you specify in your feed file, which contains your business data, such as the card issuer, annual fee, and any sign-up bonus. [!INCLUDE [TheMoreDetails](./includes/TheMoreDetails.md)]

## The benefits of using Credit card ads

[!INCLUDE [BenefitsOfDynamicDataFeeds](./includes/BenefitsOfDynamicDataFeeds.md)]
## Get started

To get started with Credit card ads, you will need to create a search campaign. Then, you will create a [dynamic data feed file ](./hlp_BA_CONC_FeedsAttributes_CreditCards.md) where you will reference the campaign. We create your credit card ads by pulling information from your feed file, such that the data in this feed file is used to generate ad copy and the settings in the expanded text ad are used for targeting and optimization.

> [!NOTE]
> Credit card ads are not available in audience campaigns or shopping campaigns.

[!INCLUDE [CreateSearchCampaign](./includes/CreateSearchCampaign.md)]
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In **Campaign settings**, select the checkbox next to **Disclaimer**. [Disclaimer in ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_Feeds_DisclaimerInAds.md) is required for Credit card ads and the campaign creation process is the only time to enable this option.
> Note: If you opt to enable Disclaimer in ads, you are only creating a placeholder now, which will soon be put into use.
