# Enhance ads with Automated Extensions

Microsoft Advertising can enhance your ads with [ad extensions](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdExtensions.md) and Automated Extensions (formerly known as annotations). Both enhancement options help to improve the visibility and performance of your ads by displaying extra information about your business – more clicks means more customer traffic. You can add ad extensions to your ads yourself but for Automated Extensions, there is no action required from you. Automated Extensions are automatically added to your ads if Microsoft Advertising determines that the Automated Extension can improve your ad performance.

Automated Extensions show data from any of the sources – your ad landing pages, ad copies, and domains your ad copy points to. Certain data, like reviews and ratings, may be provided from third-party providers.

All advertisers are eligible for Automated Extensions, however, they are not always guaranteed to show in the ads. If two competing ads have the same bid and quality, the ad with greater expected impact from ad extensions and Automated Extensions will generally appear in a higher ad position than the other.

Here are the different types of Automated Extensions available from Microsoft Advertising. Keep in mind that these are examples only and your ad might look a little different than shown below.

## Consumer Ratings

Display high consumer ratings for your business to increase customers' confidence in your ad. Consumer Ratings are reviews that are added to eligible ads. When customers click on the link for these ratings, they're taken to a third-party review page. These ratings attract more clicks, increasing confidence in your ads, and create a more engaging customer experience.
