# Status  - Definition

## What it is

Microsoft Advertising has two status types: delivery status and entity status.

## What you need to know

|Status type|What it means|
|---|---|
|Delivery status|This tells you if your campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword is operating correctly. It is found in the **Delivery** column on the **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Ads**, or **Keywords** table. The status **Eligible** indicates that your ad or keyword is available to be displayed, unless there is an issue with your account status or financial status.

|Entity status|This is the basic status of individual ad groups, ads, keywords, extensions, etc. When you create an entity, its status is set by default to **Enabled** (shown as ![Enabled icon](../images/BA_icon_active.png)). You can change this status to **Paused** (shown as ![Paused icon](../images/BA_icon_pause.png)) and back to **Enabled** at any time. [Learn more about entity status](./hlp_BA_PROC_ChgSettings.md)|
