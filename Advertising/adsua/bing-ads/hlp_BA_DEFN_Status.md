# Status  - Definition

## What it is

Microsoft Advertising has two status types: delivery status and entity status.

## What you need to know

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">
						  Status type
						</th>
    <th scope="col">
						  What it means
						</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">
						  Delivery status
						</th>
    <td>
						  This tells you if your campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword is operating correctly. It is found in the <strong>Delivery</strong> column on the <strong>Campaigns</strong>, <strong>Ad groups</strong>, <strong>Ads</strong>, or <strong>Keywords</strong> table. The status <strong>Eligible</strong> indicates that your ad or keyword is available to be displayed, unless there is an issue with your account status or financial status.

						</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">
						  Entity status
						</th>
    <td>
						  This is the basic status of individual ad groups, ads, keywords, extensions, etc. When you create an entity, its status is set by default to <strong>Enabled</strong> (shown as ![Enabled icon](../images/BA_icon_active.png)). You can change this status to <strong>Paused</strong> (shown as ![Paused icon](../images/BA_icon_pause.png)) and back to <strong>Enabled</strong> at any time.
