## How do I import a single Google Merchant Center store's offers?

## How do I manage scheduled imports from Google Merchant Center?
Go to the Scheduled Imports section of the Imports tab in Microsoft Merchant Center. There, you'll see your list of scheduled imports, and you can:

- Refresh your offers by starting an import for all or selected feeds
- Edit the default schedule for a selected feed
- Pause or delete a scheduled import

Remember that an import's default schedule is first set when the import is created. To edit an import schedule, you have two choices: you can customize the import schedule for one feed in an import, or modify the import schedule for all feeds that use the default schedule.

Also, keep in mind that if you have a scheduled import but sign out of your Google Merchant Center account, the scheduled import will continue to run. To stop the import, you must delete the scheduled import.

## To change the schedule for one feed

Let's say that you have an import with three feeds. The default schedule to import all three feeds is for Monday, 8 AM Pacific Time. You want to revise the import schedule for one of the three feeds by having it import daily.

1. From the top menu, select **Tools** > **Merchant center**.
1. Select the **Import** tab.
1. Find the feed with the schedule that you want to modify.
1. Select the pencil icon ![pencil icon](../images/BA_icon_edit.png) in the **When** column.
1. You'll see a form where you can change the frequency of the import (**When**), the **Day of the week**, the **Time**, and the **Time zone**.         Note: If you've modified a feed's import schedule and you want to change it back to its default, select the checkbox next to **Use default schedule** in this same form.
1. Select **Save** when you're finished.

## To refresh feeds at any time

If you don't want to wait for the next scheduled import to pull in new feed data, you can refresh your feeds by starting an import at any time. You don't need to schedule a new import to do this.

1. From the top menu, select **Tools** > **Merchant center**.
1. Select the **Import** tab.
1. Find the import that contains the feeds you want to refresh. Use the checkboxes to select the individual feeds to refresh or select the top check box in the column to refresh all feeds.
1. Select **Import selected feeds now.**
1. Select **Import** when you're prompted to confirm your selection.

## To change the import schedule for all feeds that use the default schedule

Take note that changing the default schedule will only apply to the feeds that use the default schedule. Feeds with customized import schedules will retain its customized schedules even if the overall default schedule is changed. Start by:

1. From the top menu, select **Tools** > **Merchant center**.
1. Select the **Import** tab.
1. Find the import that has the default schedule you want to change.
1. Select the pencil icon ![pencil icon](../images/BA_icon_edit.png) to the right of the schedule name.
1. You'll see a form where you can change the frequency of the import (**When**), the **Day of the week**, the **Time**, and the **Time zone**.
1. Select **Save** when you're finished.

## Associating new feeds to existing scheduled imports

Microsoft Merchant Center detects new feeds added to Google Merchant Center. From the Scheduled Imports tab, you'll be alerted of feeds that can be associated to existing imports.

1. From the alert banner, select **add to an existing scheduled import**.
1. You'll be taken to a new page that contains a list of Google Merchant Center feeds that are not associated to an import to Microsoft Merchant Center. Use the drop-down list to assign a feed to an existing import. (Note that each location can only have one feed. For example, you'll receive an error if you try to assign two feeds to the United States.)
1. Select **Save** when you're finished.

## To pause a scheduled import

1. From the top menu, select **Tools** > **Merchant center**.
1. Select the **Import** tab.
1. Find the import you want to pause.
1. Slide the switch to the left to pause the scheduled import for all feeds. (To resume the import, just slide the  same switch to the right.)

## To delete a scheduled import

Keep in mind that deleting a scheduled import does not delete the offers from that feed. It only deletes the scheduled import.

1. From the top menu, select **Tools** > **Merchant center**.
1. Select the **Import** tab.
1. Find the import you want to delete.
1. To the right of **Default schedule**, you'll see **Delete this schedule**. Select that link.
1. You'll see a box asking you to confirm the deletion. Select **Delete**.
