# Custom audiences: Create richer user segments with your own data

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom audiences are available in all Microsoft Advertising markets except within the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

A custom audience is a type of remarketing list that is generated by using your own customer data to create richer user segments. You can use custom audiences in conjunction with a supported data management provider (DMP)â€”currently supported DMPs are Adobe Audience Manager, Oracle Blukai, and LiveRamp. When your DMP connects to our custom audience feature, you can then import your custom audiences into Microsoft Advertising for search remarketing.

Through your DMP, you can segment your customer data however you see fit. For example, segment customers by purchase history, lifetime value, tenure, subscriber type, time since last purchase, or customer referrals.

## Why use custom audiences?

**No extra data management needed**. Custom audiences allow you to use the audience data you already have.

**Just the right audience**. Create richer audience segments using your insights and customer data.

**Similar to remarketing**. Custom audiences can be associated to ad groups or campaigns as target and bid, bid only, or as an exclusion.

## Using custom audiences

## How do I set up custom audiences?
To get started with custom audiences, you must have an account with a supported DMP: Adobe Audience Manager, Oracle Blukai, or LiveRamp.

Depending on the provider, they'll have their own enablement steps within their software.  Be sure to contact your DMP for details on how to enable this feature.

Once the integration has been completed, your custom audiences will appear in the **Audiences** section of the **Shared Library** in Microsoft Advertising.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you set up a custom audience, you will be asked to confirm that you are using only first-party audience data (your customer data that you collected from your own website or apps, for example). Only first-party audience data is allowed for targeting on Microsoft Advertising.

## How do I associate custom audiences?
1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Audiences** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Audiences**).

1. Select the ad group or campaign you want to associate with one or more audiences.
