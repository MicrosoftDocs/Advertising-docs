# Smart campaigns: Where and when will my ads appear?

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

With smart campaigns, your ads will be shown:

- On the Microsoft Search Network
- When people on those sites search for relevant search phrases

Let's break down what each of those points mean.

## The Microsoft Search Network

The Microsoft Search Network includes sites owned and operated by Bing (including Bing.com and MSN.com), AOL, and Yahoo, as well as sites that partner with Bing, AOL, and Yahoo to use Bing or Yahoo search results.

## How searches trigger your ad

When people search for a word or phrase on one of these sites, they see a **search results page** with links to the most relevant websites alongside relevant **search ads**. Which ads appear—and which appear more prominently—is determined by an auction that takes place in a fraction of a second after the search.

With smart campaigns, Microsoft Advertising's AI determines what search phrases to bid on and how much to bid on each one, informed by:

- The business category, products or services, and location you have set for this smart campaign, and the geographical locations in which you told us to display your ads. [Learn more about these settings and how to edit them](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Targeting.md).
- Your campaign budget.  [Learn more about budgets and how to edit them](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Budget.md).

You can see which search phrases brought up your ads by checking the **Search phrases** tile of your campaign's details page (from the **All campaigns** page, click **Campaign details**). If you see search phrases here that aren't relevant to your products or services, click **Manage search phrases**, then click on the search phrase's status icon and select **Pause**.
