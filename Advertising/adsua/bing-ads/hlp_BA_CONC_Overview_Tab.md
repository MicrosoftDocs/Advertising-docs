## Overview tiles

The Overview tiles provide you with dynamic and visually rich insights into your campaigns’ performance. You can easily select and drag which tiles to display and interact with as well as review key components of your Microsoft Advertising campaigns. We will continue to add more tiles over time to help users view and manage their data.

## Campaigns
The Campaigns tile shows the top 6 campaigns or ad groups of interest based on their performance data for the selected date range. You can rank your campaigns by changing the performance metrics shown in the card or the order between ascending and descending. When period comparison is on, you can also organize them by value, change value, or change percentage.
## Devices
The Devices tile shows how your campaigns are doing by device type (desktop, mobile, tablet). By simultaneously displaying an overview of your devices' key metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) at once, this tile is a quick and easy way to gain insight into which devices are most effective for the advertiser.
## Keywords
The Keyword tile shows the top 6 keywords of interest based on their performance data for the selected date range. You can rank your keywords by changing the performance metrics shown in the card or the order between ascending and descending. When period comparison is on, you can also organize them by value, change value, or change percentage. Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry. It's coming soon!
## Recommendations
The Recommendations tile proposes relevant and actionable suggestions to improve the performance of your campaign. They are based on a variety of factors, including your campaign settings and performance and Microsoft Advertising marketplace dynamics.
## Performance
The Performance tile shows trend lines of how campaigns are doing over the selected date range. View your campaigns’ spend, conversions, clicks, impressions, and select-through rate all in one place to easily recognize your campaigns’ patterns and trends.
## Searches
The Searches tile gives you a quick glance into what queries potential customers are searching for. This information allows you to determine which search queries are triggering your ads, but provide detailed performance data about them as well. The Searches tile also allows you to add search terms as a keyword or negative keyword, and even acts as an entry point directly to the search term grid. If you don't, don't worry. It's coming soon!
## Tips
The Tips tile reveals key untapped strategies to ensure that you are getting the most out of your Microsoft Advertising experience. Through guidance, help topics, and videos, the Tips tile is a great way to stay on top of your account while taking advantage of crucial tactics that you may have originally missed.
## Top Changes
The Top Changes tile identifies the campaigns and ad groups responsible for the biggest increases and decreases to your performance metrics during a specified time period. Performance Insights are available for clicks, impressions, and spend. [Learn more about Performance Insights](./hlp_BA_CONC_PerformanceInsights.md).
> [!NOTE]
> Performance Insights are only available when Microsoft Advertising can determine what caused your performance to fluctuate.

## Top Locations
This tile highlights up to ten of the best performing locations out of all the location targets you initially set. Deeper insights into these locations allow you to better allocate your time, effort, and budget within your campaigns.
