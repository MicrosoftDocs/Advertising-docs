# Add your keywords

Keywords are the words or phrases that you associate with your ads so that potential customers searching the web can find your ads. Think about how a customer would search for products or services that you offer when you choose your keywords. You can then decide how closely you want the search queries to match your keyword, which is determined by what we call **keyword match types**.

If you’re a new Microsoft Advertising user, we recommend **broad match** for your keyword match type. Broad match means your ads can show if a relevant variation of your keyword is included when a customer does a search. Using broad match attracts more visitors to your website without having to spend a lot of time building keyword lists. Learn more about the different match types [here](./hlp_BA_CONC_MatchOptions.md).

## Add keywords
1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Keywords** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Keywords**).
1. Click **Add keywords**.
1. Under **Enter keywords**, either:
   1. Type your keywords in the text box.
   1. Use **Get keyword suggestions** for additional keyword ideas.

Note: A keyword cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.

1. When you've added the keywords you want to use, click **Save**.

 
## What are negative keywords?

Negative keywords prevent your ads from showing for searches that won’t likely lead to sales. For example, Sarah owns a toy store and wants to run a sale for electronics for kids. To avoid paying for clicks for customers searching other types of toys like "dolls", "board games", or "puzzles", she could create a negative keywords list to include these keywords. Learn more about negative keywords [here](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddNegativeKeywords.md).

## Add negative keywords
1. From the **Campaigns** page, click the **Keywords** tab (or from the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns** and then **Keywords**).
1. Click **Negative keywords** and then select either **Campaign** or **Ad group**.
1. Click **Add negative keywords**.
1. Select the campaign or ad group that you'd like to edit, then enter your negative keywords.
