# How do I preview my ad in Bing search results?

The Ad Preview and Diagnostics Tool lets you quickly confirm that your ad is showing correctly on Bing without impacting impressions or clicks.    If your ad isn't on the first page of search results, we will explain why and offer suggestions on getting it there.

You can preview both your text ads and product ads.        To see if your ad is on the first page of search results:

1. Click **Tools** in the top right corner of the page, and then click **Ad Preview and Diagnostics Tool** (or from the global menu, click **Tools** > **Ad Preview &amp; Diagnostics**).
1. On the **        Ad Preview and Diagnostics Tool      ** page, type the keyword or search query for which you want to find search ads.
1. Select the targeting options (**Language**, **Domain**, **Location**, and **Device**) for which you want to preview your ads.
1. Click **Preview**.
If you see any of these messages, take the below steps:

## "Do you want to view only the webpage content that was delivered securely?"
Click **No** to proceed.
## "This page contains both secure and nonsecure items."
Click **Yes** to proceed.
## "Your ad is not showing."
- In the **Reason for not showing** column for each keyword listed, click the short summary to see a full description and a suggested action.
- Follow the action suggested.
- Click **Close**.

> [!NOTE]
> If your account is inactive or paused the tool will show you a preview of the first page of search results,      but won't show any diagnostic information because ads in paused or inactive accounts aren't eligible to be served.
> In addition to accessing it from the **Tools** page, you can also get to the Ad Preview Tool directly [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=524750) without having to sign in to Microsoft Advertising.
> Currently, the Ad Preview and Diagnostics Tool does not support dynamic search ads.
