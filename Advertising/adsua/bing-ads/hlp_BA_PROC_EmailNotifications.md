# Setting email preferences

You can opt in and out of certain Microsoft Advertising account and marketing emails using **Email preferences** under **Settings**.

Email preferences determine whether or not you receive account-related emails meant to help you manage and optimize your Microsoft Advertising experience, such as how to improve your campaigns or how to set your budget to meet your goals. Declining these emails will reduce but not eliminate all Microsoft Advertising emails. For example, Primary Contacts will continue to receive critical notifications that are actionable for someone with Super Admin or Standard User access. These include alerts for depleted budgets, security notices, and billing purposes.

As the name implies, accounts alerts are set at the account level. This means that if you have access to multiple accounts, you can specify email preferences for each account, including linked accounts you have access to as a direct manager. However, keep in mind that Super Admins can change your notification preferences at any time. (Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md))

## Account notifications sent by Microsoft Advertising

You can manage settings for the following notification categories.

- **Billing alerts:**  Statements and billing information for monthly invoice, prepay, or postpay threshold accounts
- **Account management:**  Alerts when your account can't serve ads
- **Disapproved ads and keywords:**  Editorial rejections and policy violations
- **Ad performance optimization:**  Campaign optimization suggestions, performance diagnosis, the Microsoft Advertising Dash newsletter, and competitive insights
- **Payments and account balance:**  Card issues, payment failures, low-balance warnings, and account pause warnings
- **Insertion Orders:**  Insertion order approval requests, rejections, low balance, and expiring orders (available only for monthly invoice accounts)

## How to set email preferences

The steps vary depending on whether you have access to one account or multiple accounts.

## If you have access to one account
1. [!INCLUDE [PreferencesEmailPreferences](./includes/PreferencesEmailPreferences.md)]
1. Select your user name. If you're a super admin, you can also set email preferences for other users.
1. For each notification category, slide the switch to the left to turn **Off** notifications, or slide the switch to the right to turn **On** notifications.
1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page when you're done.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We'll extend your current email preferences as you add or gain access to accounts. If you opt to receive all notifications, then you'll also receive all notifications for newly added accounts. If you opt out of some or all notifications, then you won't receive those notifications for your newly added accounts. As a best practice, you should review email preferences as you add or gain access to accounts.

## If you have access to multiple accounts
1. [!INCLUDE [PreferencesEmailPreferences](./includes/PreferencesEmailPreferences.md)]
1. Select your user name. If you're a super admin, you can also set email preferences for other users.
1. For each notification category, click the pencil icon ![pencil icon](../images/BA_icon_edit.png) to see the full list of accounts you have access to. Use the check boxes to make your selections.

## Marketing preferences
