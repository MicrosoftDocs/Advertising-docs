# What are Merchant Promotions policies and editorial guidelines?

Every Merchant Promotion submitted to Microsoft Advertising must be accurate, truthful, and comply with [Microsoft Advertising policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341). Take a look at the policies that are specific to Merchant Promotions below. Familiarizing yourself with these policies before you submit your promotion can make the approval process much smoother, so you can start displaying your promotions faster!

## Merchant Promotion policies
- **Availability**: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, India, France, and Germany on PC and mobile devices .
- Each merchant can have a maximum of 1,000 live promotions at any given time.
- A maximum of 10 promotion IDs can be mapped to one item in the product feed.
- The minimum discount amount must be at least $5 or 5% off the current price of the item.
- Promotions canâ€™t last longer than 6 months.
- Promotion redemption cannot be restricted to a certain audience (for example, military discounts, birthdays, first-time customers).
- Discounts and promotions must be applied at checkout or point of sale. Do not have discounts and promotions reflected in the SKU price on the MicrosoftShopping product page or your product landing page.
- Receipt of free gifts or e-cards can be displayed on the product landing page and must also be displayed in the cart or on the checkout page.
- Any duplicate promotions (identical promotions with different promotion IDs) will be rejected.
- Promotions for products or services that are normally free, sweepstake offers, or text-only offers meant to advertise the product without a discount are not allowed.
- Additional costs cannot be added to promotional items to offset the promotion cost. In other words, you cannot add a fee to customers redeeming a promotion that is not applicable to customers who are not using the promotion.
- Promotions must be redeemable without additional user requirements, such as signing up for a store credit card or taking a survey to redeem the promotion.
- Promotion titles must be clear, concise, accurate, and only represent the value of the specific promotional offer.
- Any promotion that is tied to a product that is not participating in the promotion will be rejected.
