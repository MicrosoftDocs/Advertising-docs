# Set up UET tags using BigCommerce

> [!NOTE]
> This article shows how to do a basic setup of UET tags using BigCommerce. Please refer to [BigCommerce Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2010484) for more information.

If you created and manage your website with BigCommerce, you can add and manage your UET tag there.

## Implementing UET using BigCommerce

1. In Microsoft Advertising, go to **Conversion Tracking**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**UET tags** and copy your JavaScript UET tag tracking code.
1. Log in to your BigCommerce account.
1. From your BigCommerce dashboard, go to **Storefront**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**Footer Scripts**.
1. Paste the Microsoft Advertising UET tracking code into the script box and click **Save**.

If you want to track completed purchases as conversions and report variable revenue, please refer to BigCommerceâ€™s support page to learn how to set up the goals and track the conversions. Here's an example:

1. From your BigCommerce dashboard, go to **Advanced Settings**&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;**Affiliate Conversion Tracking**.
1. Paste in your UET tracking code and then append the following code to the end of the UET tracking code:
```
<window.uetq = window.uetq || [];window.uetq.push({ 'revenue_value': '%%ORDER_AMOUNT%%'});>
```

1. Click **Save** to finish.

> [!NOTE]
> To validate that your BigCommerce UET tag is working, download and install [UET Tag Helper](./hlp_BA_CONC_UET_TagHelper.md). Go to your BigCommerce website and verify that a UET event is received and that the **Tag ID** matches the tag you selected in Step 1 (or defined in step 7).
