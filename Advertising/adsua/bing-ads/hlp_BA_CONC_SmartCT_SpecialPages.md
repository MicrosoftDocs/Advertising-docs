# Smart campaigns: Define special pages of your website

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

Some pages on your website are more important than others, depending on your business goal. You can define these as **Special pages** when you [set up customer action tracking](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCT_Intro.md). Microsoft Advertising can then give you more detailed information on how customers interact with these pages. This is the insight you need to ensure you're getting the return on investment (ROI) you want from your ad campaign.

## What are my special pages?

Well, what's your business goal?

- If you're trying to **sell products** , then your special pages might be pages like product descriptions and order confirmations.
- If you're trying to **generate leads** , then your special pages might be sign-up pages.
- If you're trying to **raise brand awareness** , then your special pages might be blog posts about your brand.

> [!NOTE]
> Do you have multiple business goals for the same website? For example, maybe you want to sell products, but also drive service-plan adoption. We strongly recommend creating a separate ad campaign for each goal. That way, each goal can have separate ads, performance metrics, and budget.

## URLs for special pages

When you add a special page, the qualifier (Contains, Equals, or Begins with) gives you flexibility in how you define its URL.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Qualifier</th>
    <th scope="col">Example</th>
    <th scope="col">Why you might use it</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle">Contains</th>
    <td>Contoso5000</td>
    <td>You want every page about a specific brand to be counted as this special page.</td>
  </tr>
