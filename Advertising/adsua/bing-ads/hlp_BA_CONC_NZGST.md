# New Zealand Goods and Services Tax

For businesses in New Zealand, Microsoft Advertising is required to charge the New Zealand Goods and Services Tax (NZ GST) on advertising services unless you provide your NZ GST registration number. If you provide your NZ GST registration number, Microsoft Advertising will apply NZ GST at 0%. If you do not provide your NZ GST registration number, Microsoft Advertising is required to charge 15% NZ GST.

Microsoft Advertising cannot provide guidance on tax. Please contact your tax advisor or local tax office if you have questions.

## How to update your New Zealand GST registration number

You can provide your New Zealand GST registration number when you sign up for Microsoft Advertising and each time you create a new account. The registration number will appear on your billing documents.

How you edit your NZ GST registration number depends on whether you have one account or multiple accounts.

1. [!INCLUDE [PreferencesAccountSettings](./includes/PreferencesAccountSettings.md)]
1. Next to the **Account settings** page title, click the pencil icon ![edit icon](../images/BA_icon_edit.png).
1. Enter your **NZ GST registration number**, located just below your business address.
1. Click **Save**.

## How is GST applied to my account?

- If you have a postpay threshold or monthly invoice account, GST is added onto your billing threshold amount. For example, if your billing threshold is NZ$100, your card will be charged NZ$115 (NZ$100 + 15% GST). ([Learn about billing threshold.](./hlp_BA_CONC_BillingThreshold.md))
- If you have a prepay account, taxes are deducted from your payment. For example, if you make a NZ$100 prepayment, your account balance will increase by NZ$86.96 and the remainder of your payment will be the tax amount (NZ$13.04).
