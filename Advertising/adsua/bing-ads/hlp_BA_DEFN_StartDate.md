# Start date - Definition

## What it is

Microsoft Advertising starts running your ad shortly after you create it unless its ad group has a start date set for a date in the future (or unless there is [an error with your account](./hlp_BA_CONC_AccountErrors.md)). You can see and change your ad group’s start date by going to the the ad group’s Settings and clicking **Schedule** under the **Advanced settings** section. When you select a start date in the future, your ad will start running at 12:00 a.m. of that date.

## Why it's important

You can set your ads to start on a certain date, which is particularly convenient when running ads for a special occasion, like a holiday sale (in such a case, you may also want to set an [end date](./hlp_BA_DEFN_EndDate.md)).
