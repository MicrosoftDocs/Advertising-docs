# App extensions: Promote and link to your apps

App extensions are additional elements of your ad that promote your app across PCs, tablets, and smartphones. Here are a few key benefits of using app extensions:

- Adding an app extension to your ad is free and you only pay when your app extension link is clicked.
- Promoting app installs in your ad increases downloads and usage of your app, in addition to website visits.
- Clicks and app installs can be tracked as conversions at the campaign and ad group levels.

With app extensions, a customer’s device and operating system is automatically detected and will take the user directly to the correct app store.

## Compare app extensions and app install ads

An app extension is similar to an [app install ad](./hlp_BA_CONC_AppInstallAds.md). They both use third-party measurement URLs to track conversion goals. Both include app icons and send users to the app store as appropriate for the device they are using. Here are some key differences:

## Get to know app extensions

When you create an app extension, you’ll want basic information on hand: **mobile operating system**, **app ID/package name**, **link text**, and **link URL**.

Consider if you’d like to report app installs as a conversion goal. If you do, you’ll want to sign up with a Microsoft Advertising-certified partner to view app installs as conversions within the Microsoft Advertising report. Check out [tracking mobile app installs as conversions](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2MobileApp.md) for help setting up those goals.

Whether or not your ad shows on mobile devices only depends on several things, including your ad group device preferences and if you have other ads in your ad group. App extensions will serve on mobile and tablet devices, but if you prefer that your ads appear on mobile devices, be sure to select **Prefer mobile devices**. Selecting this preference doesn't mean that your ads will be excluded from tablets.

Your **app ID** can be found in the URL of the app from the respective app store.
