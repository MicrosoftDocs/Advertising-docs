# Deleting a payment method

You can delete a credit card, debit card, or other payment method, unless it is set as the primary payment method for an account. If it is, then you'll need to set a new one before you can delete the payment method. For more info, see [How to change payment methods](./hlp_BA_PROC_Account_AssociateCCard.md).

1. [!INCLUDE [BillingPaymentsPaymentMethods](./includes/BillingPaymentsPaymentMethods.md)]
1. In the list of payment methods, locate the payment method you want to delete and select **Delete**.
1. When the confirmation message appears, select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only users with full permissions (Super Admins) can add, edit, or delete a payment method. Learn more [about user roles.](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md)
> The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires  Microsoft Advertising to maintain financial records for tax reporting purposes. You can delete credit or debit card information so that it is no longer displayed in Microsoft Advertising. However, doing so does not remove the credit or debit card information from the Microsoft Advertising database.
