# Add a Get a Ride icon to your ad

The Get a Ride feature for Location Extensions offers iPhone users an easy way to call for a ride to your business from your ad. A customer can click the ride icon in your ad that launches the Uber app and if they're logged in to their Uber account, the destination will be pre-populated with your address. This feature is like an annotation, where it could be automatically included in your ad with no additional set-up from your end. If you want to opt out of Get a Ride, please contact your Account Manager or [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371).
