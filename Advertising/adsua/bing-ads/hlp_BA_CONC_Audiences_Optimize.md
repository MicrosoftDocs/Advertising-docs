# Optimize for audience targeting

Once you have [created an audience](./hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_CreateAudience.md) and [associated it with ad groups or campaigns](./hlp_BA_CONC_Audiences_AssociateAdGroup.md), you can set a different bid amount to target it. You can also create new campaigns to show specific ads or define broad match keywords for this audience.

## Set a specific bid amount
You can increase or decrease the bid amount, or bid boost, for the specific audiences. For example, you could increase your bids for shopping cart abandoners and reduce your bids for people that already made purchased your products.

1. From the main menu on the left, select **All campaigns** and then **Audiences**.
1. Select the name of the audience you want to edit.
1. Select **Edit** and then **Change bid adjustment**.
1. Select **Increase by** or **Decrease by** and enter the amount in percent.             You can increase the bid up to 900% and decrease by 90%.

> Bid adjustments don't apply to an excluded audience association.
