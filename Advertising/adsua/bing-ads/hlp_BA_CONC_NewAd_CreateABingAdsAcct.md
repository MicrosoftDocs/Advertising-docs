![Sign Up](../images/BA_Conc_SignUp.svg)
Signing up with Microsoft Advertising is free and you can do it at any time by visiting [Microsoft Advertising sign up](https://ads.microsoft.com/signup?s_cid=signup_help). All you need is an existing email address or you can create a new email address (a Microsoft account), along with a few details about your business to get your account up and running.

## Use an existing email address to create an account
1. Go to the [ Microsoft Advertising sign-up](https://ads.microsoft.com/signup?s_cid=signup_help) page and enter an existing email address (work, school, or personal email address from a service such as Outlook, Gmail, or Yahoo).
If you have an email address you already use to sign in to Microsoft products (like Skype or Xbox LIVE), all you need to do is sign in and the transition will be complete. If you've never used this email to sign in to a Microsoft product, you’ll be able to sign up for a new account.

1. Otherwise, click **Create one!** next to **No account?**, and then click **Next**.
1. In the following window, confirm that you want to create a new account and then click **Next**.
1. Create a password and click **Next**.
1. Enter your **First name** and **Last name**, and then click **Next**.
1. You'll need to enter the verification that Microsoft Advertising sent to the email address you provided. Check your email, enter the code in the prompt, and click **Next**.
1. Provide your **Company name** and **Business phone**. Please confirm your **Business location**, **Currency**, **Time zone**, and **Primary use** (if you're using the account to promote a business or if you're using an account on behalf of an ad agency).
1. Review the **Microsoft Advertising Terms and Conditions** and click the box if you agree to the terms. Then, click **Create account**.
1. After you’ve created your Microsoft Advertising account, you can set up your campaign by **importing from Google Ads** or by **creating a new campaign**. You can also skip this step and click **Continue**.
1. Enter your billing and payment information and click **Next**. You can also skip this step and enter your billing and payment information later by clicking **Skip**.
