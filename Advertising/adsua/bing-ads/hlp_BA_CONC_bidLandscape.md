# Bid landscape: View impression and cost simulations before changing your bid

Before changing your bid, you’ll want to know the impact that change will have on your impressions and costs.  Lowering your bid might leave you with too few impressions. Raising your bid might cost you more than you want to spend.

To help estimate the affect a bid change will have on your campaign, Microsoft Advertising has bid landscape. Bid landscape provides a range of bids for a keyword, along with a simulation of the estimated impressions and clicks those bids might bring for that keyword. If you see a simulation that gives the performance you’re looking for, you can then change your bid within bid landscape.

## View bid landscape at the ad group or keyword level
Bid landscape is only available if there is sufficient impression and click data for your keywords. If there is data available, a small graph will appear next to each of your bids on the **Keywords** or **Ad groups** table. To view the bid landscape simulation:
1. On the **Keywords** or **Ad groups** table, select the graph icon next to the current bid you want to review.
1. To simulate a different bid, select an option from the **Keyword bid** column or enter an amount in **Other bid**.
1. If you are happy with the simulation and want to make it your new keyword bid, select **Save**.

At the ad group level, you can choose to change all of your keyword bids or you can update only your ad group bid and leave your individual keyword bids unchanged.

## View bid landscape at the campaign level
Bid landscape is only available if there is sufficient impression and click data for your keywords. If there is data available, a small graph will appear next to each of your bids on the **Campaigns** table. To view the bid landscape simulation:
1. On the **Campaigns** table, select the graph icon in the **Bid** column of the campaign you want to review.
1. Choose which kind of simulation you want: **Bid scaling** (increase or decrease all your bids by a percentage) or **Campaign-wide bid** (set all of your bids to the same, specific value).
   1. **Bid scaling** : To simulate increasing or decreasing bids by a percentage, select an option in the **Keyword bid** column or enter a percentage in **Other bid adjustment**.
   1. **Campaign-wide bid** : To simulate a different bid, select an option from the **Keyword bid** column or enter an amount in **Other bid**.

1. If you are happy with the simulation and want to make it your new keyword bid, select **Save**.

## View bid landscape for Microsoft Shopping Campaigns
Bid landscape is only available if there is sufficient impression and click data for your keywords. If there is data available, a small graph will appear next to each of your bids on the **product group** grid. To view the bid landscape simulation:
1. On the **product group** grid, select the graph icon next to the current bid you want to review.
1. To simulate a different bid, select an option from the **Keyword bid** column or enter an amount in **Other bid**.
1. If you are happy with the simulation and want to make it your new keyword bid, select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Bid landscape data might differ slightly from what you will see in other places in Microsoft Advertising, such as in custom-generated reports. This difference can be caused by a number of factors, such as different time ranges.
> Bid landscape simulations are estimates and do not guarantee future results.
