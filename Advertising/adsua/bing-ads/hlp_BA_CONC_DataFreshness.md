# Is my data updated in real time?

When you are reviewing your Microsoft Advertising metrics to see how you can improve your campaign performance,  it is important to know if the most recent activity is included. Most metrics are in real time and are continually updated during the day.   A few metrics take a bit longer to load and some reports are updated once a day.

The following table shows the delays in data freshness.
