# Import merchant center stores from Google Ads

If you’re already using Google Ads to advertise on Google, you can import these campaigns into Microsoft Advertising so that you can run the same ads on Bing.

You can only import shopping campaigns from Google Ads to Microsoft Advertising if you have a Microsoft Merchant Center store. Without a store, your shopping campaigns will not be imported with your other campaigns and settings from Google Ads. If you don’t have a store yet, we’ll help you set one up.

## Get started

To get started, follow the steps in [Import campaigns directly from Google Ads](./hlp_BA_PROC_ImportCampaign.md). Choose a Google Ads account or specific campaigns in the account. If we find that you are importing shopping campaigns from Google Ads, you'll have the option to select or create a store.

- **Existing Microsoft Merchant Center store**: You can choose an existing Microsoft Merchant Center store to use for your shopping campaigns. We'll suggest a matching store, but you can change the selection.
- **Import a Google Merchant Center store**: If you login to your Google Merchant Center, we can import those stores into Microsoft Merchant Center. This will create a Microsoft Merchant Center store with the same name, domain, and settings as your Google Merchant Center store. Your feeds will begin importing automatically and your campaigns will go live when the feed import is complete.
- **Draft store**: Draft stores are temporary stores meant to hold the place of an active, approved store. You should only choose this option if you are unsure which store to select or if you would like to setup the store later. If your campaigns are using a draft store, they are not active. You will need to go to the Microsoft Merchant Center to finish the setup of your store in order for you campaigns to go live.

We recommend that you sign into your Google Merchant Center account before choosing a store. Then, we’ll have more information such as the store name and domain that will help us suggest a store for you to select.
