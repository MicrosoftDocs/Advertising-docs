# How Call and Location Extensions work together

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Call Extensions are only available in the United States and United Kingdom.

[Call Extensions,](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddCallExtension.md) can be used together with [Location Extensions](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddLocationExtension.md). When these two features are used at the same time, the phone number displayed (coming from one or the other extension) and the availability of tap-to-call depend on the device where the ad is being viewed. The table below describes what you can expect.
