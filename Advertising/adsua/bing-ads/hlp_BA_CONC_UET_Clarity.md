# UET and Clarity integration

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
[Clarity](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2167826) is Microsoftâ€™s free behavioral analysis tool that helps you understand how customers interact with your website. By integrating Universal Event Tracking (UET) with Clarity, you can use a single UET tag for behavioral insights such as heatmaps and session playbacks, conversion tracking, automated bidding, and audience targeting. Once enabled, your UET tag sends data, or signals, from your website to Clarity.

## Enable an existing UET tag for Clarity

1. [!INCLUDE [UetTag](./includes/UetTag.md)]
1. In the table, select the **Tag name**      for the tag you want to enable Clarity for.
1. Select the checkbox for **Enable Microsoft&nbsp;Clarity**.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> New UET tags are enabled to capture Clarity data by default. [Learn more about creating a UET tag](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2CreateTag.md).
> You can disable Clarity signals either during or after UET tag creation.
> To learn more about Clarity, its features, and what data it captures, visit the [Clarity documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2167826).
