# Share website exclusion lists across accounts

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available from the redesigned Microsoft Advertising.

You can keep your ads from showing on specific websites using account-level website exclusion lists.

## What you need to know about website exclusion lists

- Account-level website exclusions are applied in addition to any exclusions set at the campaign or ad-group level.
- Shared website exclusion lists are created, edited, and deleted from the manager-account level. At the account level, you can view and disassociate lists.
- Once you create a website exclusion list, you must associate it with at least one account for it to take effect.
- You can't add Microsoft sites (such as microsoft.com) to your excluded websites list.
- Maximums:
  - 3 shared website exclusion lists per manager account.
  - 10,000 URLs per website exclusion list (but you cannot add more than 5,000 at one time).
  - No limit on the number of accounts a website exclusion list may be associated with.

## Create account-level website exclusion lists

1. At the manager-account level, from the global menu, click **Tools** and then **Website exclusion lists**.
1. On the **Website exclusion lists** page, click **Create website exclusion list**.
1. Name your list in the **List name** box.
1. Enter the URLs of websites that you don't want your ads to show on.
## Examples of URL formats
contoso.com 					www.contoso.com 					autos.contoso.com 					contoso.com/widgets 					http://www.contoso.com 					https://www.contoso.com
Tip: If you want to exclude any page on a specific domain, leave off the "www" prefix. For example, use "contoso.com" if you want to block traffic from www.contoso.com and www2.contoso.com.

1. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
