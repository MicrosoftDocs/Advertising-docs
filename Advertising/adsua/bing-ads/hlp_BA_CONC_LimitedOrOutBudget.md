# What can I do to change Limited or Out of Budget delivery status?

The delivery status tells you if your ads are available to display.  The following messages indicate your ads might not display as often as they could:

- **Limited by budget** . Your ads are running, but to avoid going over your daily budget, Microsoft Advertising occasionally limits the number of times your ad is shown. If your campaign has this status, it can still be successful. But if you increase your budget, your ads might show more often.  This status means that your campaign ran out of budget at least once in the past 15 days or that we've determined that your campaign will run out of budget in the coming weeks.
- **Campaign out of budget** . No ads are running for this campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword because your campaign budget has been used up for the day.

## What you can do

If you see either of these statuses in the Delivery column on the Campaigns page, you can select the ellipsis icon ![More information icon](../images/BA_ScreenCap_DeliveryDetails.png) next to it (or hover over the status) and Microsoft Advertising will suggest a few different daily budgets that might increase your ad exposure. If you want to see a larger list of budget suggestions, you can click **See more suggestions** and open Recommendations to **Increase your campaign budgets to show your ads more frequently**.
