# About language options in Microsoft Advertising

Three language options in Microsoft Advertising give you control over your advertising campaign and experience.

## Ad language: Your target customers
Your campaign ad language determines the language that you will use when you write your ads and should be the language of your customers.

You can choose an ad group-level language when you [create an ad group](./hlp_BA_CONC_NewAd_CreateANewAdGroup.md), but it cannot be changed later. If there is no ad group language, then all the campaign languages will apply to the ad groups.

Your ad language, in combination with your location targeting, determines who will see your ads. To learn more, see [How does ad language and location targeting affect who can see my ads?](./hlp_BA_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)

## Available ad languages
