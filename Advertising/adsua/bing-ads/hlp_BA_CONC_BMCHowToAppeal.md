# How to appeal a rejected offer

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
During our editorial review process, we reject product offers that violate one or more of the [Microsoft Advertising Policies and Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341). If you have made changes to comply with the policies or believe we have incorrectly classified your offers, you may request an appeal.

## What you need to know

- You should only request an appeal when you are confident that you have made changes to comply with the policies and guidelines or believe we have incorrectly classified your product offers.
- If you have already appealed the rejection and were denied, you are unable to request another appeal for your product offer.
- Submitting incorrect appeal requests may lead to temporary account suspension or complete termination.
- It usually takes 1-3 business days to complete a review.

## How to appeal a rejected offer

1. [!INCLUDE [MerchantCenterSummary](./includes/MerchantCenterSummary.md)]
1. In the Product issue table, select **The offer does not meet our editorial guidelines**.
1. In the Policy violation details page, find the corresponding policy violation for which you want to request an appeal.
1. Go to **View samples**.
1. Select **Request review for all**.
1. From the dropdown menu, choose either **Incorrect classification** or **Made changes to comply with policy**.
   - **Incorrect classification**: You can choose this option if we have incorrectly classified your product offer.
   - **Made changes to comply with policy**: You can choose this option if you made changes to comply with the [Microsoft Advertising Policies and Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341) and do not think your product offers should have been rejected.

1. Select **Submit**.

## Things to keep in mind when submitting an appeal request

- You can only submit one appeal request per policy violation at a time. If you need to request reviews for multiple policy violations, you will have to individually appeal each violation.
- You can request appeals for a maximum of 10,000 product offers per store per month.
- You can check the number of appealed offers in the Product issue table in your Merchant Center summary. Once we have processed your appeal, the appealed offers will be reflected in the Active or Rejected state as applicable.
- If you change your offer and reupload it while it is under appeal, then we will discard your appeal request. If we reject your offer after it is reuploaded, then it will be eligible for appeal.
