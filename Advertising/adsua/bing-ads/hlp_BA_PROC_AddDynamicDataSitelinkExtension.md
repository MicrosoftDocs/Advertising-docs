# Use dynamic data sitelink extensions to automate product and service links

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Dynamic data sitelink extensions make showcasing your products and services automatic — even when your inventory changes frequently. This extension makes it easy to update your search ads with one feed file to display up-to-date product information specific to customer searches.

Up to four items from your business dynamic data feed file will be shown as clickable links in the search ad. You can set up dynamic data sitelink extensions with other ad extensions, except for sitelink extensions.

**Ability to set up in**: United States

**Serves in**: All MSAN markets

## Get started with dynamic data sitelink extensions

Before you create a dynamic data sitelink extension, you need to [upload business data in a dynamic feed file](./hlp_BA_PROC_Feeds_WorkingWith.md). This is because when you create the extension, you need to choose one of your existing feeds.

[!INCLUDE [Available_DDFeeds](./includes/Available_DDFeeds.md)]

Each type of feed file requires a unique ID for each feed item, plus at least three to five additional required columns, or item attributes, depending on the dynamic data feed type. We recommend you provide as many attributes as possible to surface meaningful, rich data in the ads.

Once you’ve uploaded your business data, create a dynamic data sitelink extension.

[!INCLUDE [AboutAdExtensions](./includes/AboutAdExtensions.md)]

You can create up to 20 dynamic data sitelink extensions, which will be able to serve with all ads in the account. Unlike other ad extension types, there isn’t any option to limit association of a dynamic data sitelink extension to specific campaigns or ad groups.

> [!NOTE]
> To retain reporting accuracy between the feed and the extension, you should not replace the extension’s feed once ads are shown with the provided business data.
