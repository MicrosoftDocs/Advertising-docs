## Signing in

1. Enter your email address and select **Next**.
1. Enter your password and select **Sign in**.

To switch to a different account, go to the menu icon at the top left and select **Accounts**. Then just select the account from the list.

To sign out, go to the menu icon at the top left and select **Sign out**.

## Having trouble signing in?

Below are some common reasons why sign in might not work:

**"We don't recognize this Microsoft account."** You're trying to sign into the app with an email address that hasn't been associated with a Microsoft Advertising user yet. To resolve this issue, you'll need to use a Microsoft account to sign in.

When you try to sign into the app, you see the following message: **"There is no Microsoft Advertising account associated with this email address."** To resolve this issue, make sure your email address has access to a Microsoft Advertising. If your company is already using Microsoft Advertising, reach out to the person who manages the account and ask them to invite you as a new user. Once they do, you’ll be able to set yourself up as a user on the account and will then be able to sign into the app successfully.

## Campaigns

You can change your campaign budget in the Microsoft Advertising Smart Campaign mobile app by going to the Campaigns tab. Select a campaign from the list to see it in the single campaign view. Select **Edit** next to the campaign name and budget. Select the **Daily budget**. Just enter your new budget and select **Save**.

## Create or edit an ad

1. Go to the Campaigns tab.
1. Select a campaign from the list to see it in the “single campaign view.”
1. Go to the ads section and select **Edit ads**.
1. Select **Create ad** at the bottom of the campaign view. If you want to edit an existing ad, Select **Edit**.

## Notifications

The Microsoft Advertising App can send you various notifications about your account. These include:

- Account or credit hold
- Payment declined
- Card will expire
- Editorial alert for ads

To view and update notifications, go to the menu icon at the top left and select **Settings**. Then you can turn on or turn off each notification type from the list.

If you are not receiving push notifications, go into iOS **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Microsoft Ads**, and make sure **Allow Notifications** is turned on.
