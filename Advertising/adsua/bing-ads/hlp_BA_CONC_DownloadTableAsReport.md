# Instant reports: Download your Campaigns performance data

To get an instant report on campaign or ad group performance, download the statistics table found on most tabs on the Campaigns page. Each download provides a different breakdown of basic campaign statistics in a .csv or Excel file, to conveniently share the information or to use for further analysis.

You can download tables from the following tabs:
- Ads
- Keywords
- Audiences
- Auto Targets
- Change History
- Dimensions
- Competition

## Download a table

1. From the main menu on the far left, click **All Campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click the item you want to learn about. For example, **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Keywords**, or **Audiences**.
1. If you want, customize the data shown in the table â€”for example, using [columns and filters](./hlp_BA_CONC_CustomizeData.md), [segments](./hlp_BA_CONC_Segmentation.md), and the date range.
1. Click **Download** and then select the **Format** and **Segment** of the report.
1. Click **Download**.

> [!NOTE]
> Downloading tables from the Campaigns page is a quick way to get basic reports. For a greater selection of reports, or more detailed ways to dig into your data, [create reports from the Reports page](./hlp_BA_PROC_CreateReport.md).
> 
> Because of number rounding that occurs in most computing functions, the decimal values shown in the total line might differ from tab to tab.
> 
> Any customization you make to table columns applies to tables in all campaigns in your account. If you have more than one account, you'll need to set those column preferences separately for each account.
> 
> Please note that report header names will always be in English regardless of the language of the associated data.
