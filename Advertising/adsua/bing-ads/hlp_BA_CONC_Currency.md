# Choosing your account currency

Each time you [create a Microsoft Advertising account](./hlp_BA_PROC_CreateAcctSelfServe.md), you need to select the currency you will use to pay your advertising costs. Choose your currency carefully because currency can affect your billing options. Also, **after an account is set up, the currency setting cannot be changed** . For more information, see [What can I do if I selected the wrong currency?](#WrongCurrency)

If you run multiple advertising campaigns and need to pay in different currencies, that’s no problem. You just need to set up one account per currency. Currency is one of a few reasons you might need or want to set up separate accounts in Microsoft Advertising. For more information, see [How should I organize my accounts and campaigns?](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAccts.md)

You can pay for Microsoft Advertising using one of nine currencies available globally, excluding Brazil and India. There may be a few more currencies available for use in your country/region.

**Don’t see your currency in the list above?**  You might still be able to advertise with Microsoft Advertising. Check with the financial institution that issues your card to make sure that they allow international transactions. If they do, you can select any currency that your financial institution can convert into your local currency.

## How currency (and country) affect your billing options

Depending on your **country-currency** combination, you have different options for paying and some restrictions. For example, only **German-Euro** accounts can use SEPA direct debit, and **India-Indian rupee** accounts cannot use debit cards. Also, if you want to pay in Brazilian real or Indian rupee, then your billing address must be in Brazil or India, respectively.

For a full list of payment methods you can use based on your country-currency combination, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md)
