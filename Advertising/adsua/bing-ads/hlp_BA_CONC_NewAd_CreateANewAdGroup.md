# Create a new ad group

Ad groups are the best way to organize your campaigns by specific products or services that you offer. An ad group contains a set of keywords and ads that are related to a common theme. Not only do they make it easier to manage related ads and keywords, well-organized ad groups make your ads more relevant to users’ searches. This, in turn, can help improve your ROI.

For example, Sarah owns a toy store and wants to create ads to highlight specials she will be offering. She could create different ad groups for “electronics for kids” and “riding toys,” which will each contain different sets of keywords and ads.  When she wants to make adjustments to these ads, she can easily make changes to all the ads in a given ad group simultaneously.
