# About ad distribution

Use ad distribution to select where you want your ads to show. You can choose to have your ads shown on the entire search network or subsets of it.

## Ad distribution options

Within the [search network](./hlp_BA_CONC_SearchNetContentNet.md), you have several options, depending on where you're advertising. You can choose to have your ads shown on the following:

- **Bing, AOL, and Yahoo owned and operated sites**
- **Bing, AOL, and Yahoo syndicated search partner sites**  (these are sites that partner with us to use Bing and Yahoo search results -- see [this article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398369) for more information)
- **Both**
- **Sponsored Product Ads Retailer Network**  (these are a collection of retailers who support showing Sponsored Product Ads on their respective sites)

Ads on the search network may also be displayed in the Bing Smart Search results.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the Publisher Performance report, you'll see websites based on these ad distribution rules. To learn how ad language and location targeting affects who sees your ads, see [How does ad language and location targeting affect who can see my ads?](./hlp_BA_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)

 
## How to set ad distribution

Although you set ad distribution when you create a new campaign, it is an ad-group level setting. Here's how to adjust your ad distribution settings:

1. From the main menu on the left, select **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, select **Ad groups**.
1. In the table, select the name of the ad group you want to edit.
1. From the page menu, select **Settings**.
1. Under **Advanced ad group settings**, in the **Other settings** section, select **Ad distribution**.
1. Choose whether to show your ads on all parts of the search network, just Bing, AOL, and Yahoo owned and operated sites, or just Bing, AOL, and Yahoo syndicated search partner sites.
1. Select **Save**.
