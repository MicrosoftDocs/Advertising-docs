# About ad distribution

Use ad distribution to select where you want your ads to show. You can choose to have your ads shown on the entire Microsoft Advertising Network or subsets of it.

## Ad distribution options

Within the [search network](./hlp_BA_CONC_SearchNetContentNet.md), you have several ad distribution options depending on where you're advertising. You can choose to have your ads shown on the following:

- Bing, AOL, and Yahoo owned and operated sites. This option includes Microsoft Audience Ads and only applies to websites in certain locations.
- Bing, AOL, and Yahoo syndicated search partners. These are sites that partner with us to use Bing, AOL, and Yahoo search results (see [this article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398369) for more information). This option includes Microsoft Audience Ads and only applies to websites in certain locations.
- All search networks (Bing, AOL, Yahoo, and syndicated search partners). This option includes Microsoft Audience Ads.

Ads on the search network may also be displayed in the Bing Smart Search results.

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the Publisher Performance report, you'll see websites based on these ad distribution rules. To learn how ad language and location targeting affects who sees your ads, see [How does ad language and location targeting affect who can see my ads?](./hlp_BA_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)

 
## How to set ad distribution

Although you set ad distribution when you create a new campaign, it is an ad group level setting. Here's how to adjust your ad distribution settings:

1. [!INCLUDE [AdGroupsCampaigns](./includes/AdGroupsCampaigns.md)]
1. In the table, select the ad group you want to edit.
1. From the page menu, select **Settings**.
1. Under **Advanced ad group settings**, in the **Other settings** section, select **Ad distribution**.
1. Choose whether to show your ads on all search networks, just Bing, AOL, and Yahoo owned and operated sites, or just Bing, AOL, and Yahoo syndicated search partner sites.
1. Select **Save**.

> To see how to exclude websites that aren't giving you the results you want, see [How to prevent your ads from showing to certain people](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddExclusions.md).
