# How to add keywords that won't trigger my ads (negative keywords)

Use negative keywords to help prevent your ad from appearing in response to certain search queries or other input. You can add negative keywords at the campaign and ad group level, or create a shared negative keyword list to use across campaigns. [!INCLUDE [ExcKW1](./includes/ExcKW1.md)] Each shared negative keyword list can contain up to 5,000 negative keywords. [Learn more about negative keywords](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutNegativeKeywords.md).

## Add negative keywords at the campaign or ad group level

> [!NOTE]
> When adding negative keywords, do not use a hyphen ( - ) to indicate that the keyword is negative. You can use brackets ( [] ) to indicate exact match negative keywords and quotation marks ( "" ) to indicate phrase match negative keywords.
> If a campaign has multiple ad groups with different language settings, Microsoft Advertising adds the negative keywords only to ad groups that have the same language setting as the account.

## Add search terms as negative keywords

You can research search terms, and then add them to your keyword list. You can also use this feature to identify search queries that you want to avoid by creating negative keywords.
