# Destination URL - Definition

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting in August 2019, you will no longer be able to edit destination URLs at the ad, keyword, and sitelink extension level. Please update URLs at these entities to final URLs. [Learn more about Upgraded URLs](./hlp_BA_CONC_UpgradeURL_MigrateFAQ.md).

## What it is

The webpage URL people are taken to after they click your ad, which is different than the display URL that is the webpage address that appears in your ad.

![Example of an ad](../images/BA_Misc_AdExample.jpg)

## Why it's important

It is the actual webpage people are taken to when they click your ad.

## What you need to know

When creating your ad, we recommend using longer destination URL to send people to a more specific area of your website.

## An example

In the image above, Blue Yonder Airlines is advertising low fares to Europe this summer. The display URL (wwww.BlueYonderAirlines.com) lets people know where they are going when they click the ad and the destination URL can be www.BlueYonderAirlines.com/europesummersale.

> [!NOTE]
> If your website address begins with a subdomain (for example, packages in packages.BlueYonderAirlines.com), your display URL should include the subdomain as well.
> Since you want the display URL to tell people where they are going when they click the ad, we recommend that the display URL and the destination URL are on the same domain. For example, both the display and destination URL are going to the domain BlueYonderAirlines.com.
