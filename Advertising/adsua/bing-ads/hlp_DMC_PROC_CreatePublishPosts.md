## Inbox management

After connecting [social profiles](./hlp_DMC_CONC_AccountSettings.md), you can interact with your audience in the **Social** tab. From the **Inbox** page on the left menu, you can review and comment on:

- Comments and replies to your posts (Facebook, Instagram Business, LinkedIn)
- Reviews (Facebook).
- Private or direct messages (Facebook, Twitter)
- Wall posts (Facebook)
- Replies, likes, or retweets for the tweets you're mentioned in (Twitter)

Your inbox will contain all inbound comments, wall posts, and private messages across your social profiles in chronological order, for up to 90 days.

By default, all social profiles' posts are shown. You can filter the posts by selecting individual social profiles from the left menu. Just above the posts you can filter by number of days and activity types for example, view comments or reviews from the last 7 days.

New posts will be shown in the **To review** tab. You can view all posts in the **All** tab, including posts that you have marked as **Complete**. Select a post to like, reply to, or delete the post. After you reply to a post it will automatically be designated as **Complete**. You can also select **Complete** on posts that you don't want to respond to.
