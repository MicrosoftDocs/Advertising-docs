# Unified Smart campaigns: Social network engagement

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
After connecting social profiles, you can publish social media posts and interact with your audience in the **Social** tab. From the **Publisher** page on the left menu, you can create, schedule, edit, and publish posts.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note these limitations for posting on Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter
- Posting on Instagram through Microsoft Advertising is currently not available. To post on Instagram, please use the Instagram app.
- Twitter doesn't allow you to post identical content to more than 1 profile at a time.
- LinkedIn doesn't allow videos in posts.

## Create and publish a new post

1. Select the **Social** tab and then select **Publisher**. You'll see the calendar that contains all posts across your social profiles.
1. From the left menu, select **Link new social network** or select a social network that is already linked.
1. From the **Calendar** tab, select New post.

To view or edit unpublished posts, select the **Scheduled** or **Drafts** tab.

## Inbox management

After connecting [social profiles](./hlp_DMC_CONC_AccountSettings.md), you can interact with your audience in the **Social** tab. From the **Inbox** page on the left menu, you can review and comment on:

- Comments and replies to your posts (Facebook, Instagram Business, LinkedIn)
- Reviews (Facebook).
- Private or direct messages (Facebook, Twitter)
- Wall posts (Facebook)
- Replies, likes, or retweets for the tweets you're mentioned in (Twitter)

Your inbox will contain all inbound comments, wall posts, and private messages across your social profiles in chronological order, for up to 90 days.

By default, all social profiles' posts are shown. You can filter the posts by selecting individual social profiles from the left menu. Just above the posts you can filter by number of days and activity types for example, view comments or reviews from the last 7 days.

New posts will be shown in the **To review** tab. You can view all posts in the **All** tab, including posts that you have marked as **Complete**. Select a post to like, reply to, or delete the post. After you reply to a post it will automatically be designated as **Complete**. You can also select **Complete** on posts that you don't want to respond to.
