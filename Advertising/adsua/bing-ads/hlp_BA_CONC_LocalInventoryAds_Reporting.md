# Using Local Inventory Ad reports

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Local Inventory Ads are currently available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and United States.

Now that your Local Inventory Ads are up and running, you’ll want to keep track of how your ads are performing.

The following click type data is available for the reports listed below:

- **Shopping ad**: A click on your ad, showing an online product.
- ** Shopping ad – local**: A click on your ad, showing a local product.
- **Shopping ad – multichannel local**: A click on the local section of your ad that has two links. One click to the local product and another click to the online product.
- **Shopping ad – multichannel online**: A click on the in-store decoration will result in the multichannel local click reporting. Click on the main ad with the in-store decoration will result in the multichannel online click.

## Availability

We are working with retailers who have physical stores in the United Kingdom and United States.

## Add shopping ad click types to reports
When running product partition, product partition unit, or product dimension reports, be sure to add the click type column to view your shopping ad click type data.

1. On the **Reports** page, in the left pane, select the report you want to run under **Product ads** (or from the global menu, click **Reports** > **Standard reports**).
1. In the **Choose your columns** section, add the **Click type** attribute.
1. Click **Run** to generate the report, or **Download** to get the report as a .csv or .tsv file.
