# What do the report columns mean?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some listed attributes and performance statistics may be associated with report types that are still beta features, and so may not yet be available to all   Microsoft Advertising advertisers.

The reports and graphs available in Microsoft Advertising give you a rich variety of information by combining different attributes and performance statistics.     Each Microsoft Advertising report contains a subset of these attributes and statistics. Here's a list of some of the most common (or confusing) report fields.

## A
<table style="width:95%">

    <th scope="row" style="background: transparent">Absolute top impression share</th>

          Value &lt; 0.81: Competition is "Medium"</li><li>Value &gt; 0.80: Competition is "High"
            </li></ul>
              Highly competitive keywords are more popular among advertisers and, therefore, tend to require larger bids to get the better ad positions. Keywords with medium or low competition might offer advertisers a better ROI.
