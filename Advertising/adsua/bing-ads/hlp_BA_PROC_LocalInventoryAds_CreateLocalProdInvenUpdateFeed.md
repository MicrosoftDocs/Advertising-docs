# How do I create and submit local product inventory update feeds?

> [!NOTE]
> Local Inventory Ads are currently available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and United States.

For product inventory attributes that are updated frequently, like price and quantity, you can easily make updates using local product inventory update feeds.

## When should I use the local product inventory update feed?

We recommend that you submit your full local product inventory feed once a day. But when you want to update only the price and quantity attributes that have already been submitted in your main local product inventory feed file, you can do so without having to update the entire feed.

## Availability

We are working with retailers who have physical stores in the United Kingdom and United States.

## Upload feed file via FTP (Files under 1GB)

You can use this option if the feed file is smaller than 1GB. This is the recommended option if the feed file is larger than 4MB.

When submitting via FTP:

- The file name must be in the following format: inventoryfeed_{market}.txt (for example, inventoryfeed_enus.txt).
- The supported market values are enus, enuk, dede, frfr, enau, enca, and enin.
- The file name is case sensitive.
- If you send the file with a zip file, both the zip file name and the file name must follow the naming format above.

**FTP server requirements**

The recommended FTP upload mechanism is via an FTP program. It is however possible to do so via the command line or custom scripts (such as Python’s ftplib.FTP module). The FileZilla FTP client is recommended for all platforms.

Use the following settings for file transfer with your FTP client:

- Host: ftps://feeds.adcenter.microsoft.com
- Username: Your store’s FTP user name. Your user name must be 6 - 64 characters and cannot include any special characters. Use only a - z, A- Z, and 0 - 9.
- Password: Your store’s FTP password
- Transfer Mode: Passive

Learn more about [FTP uploads](./hlp_BA_CONC_BMCFTPRequirements.md).

The feed contains the following attributes, as detailed below:

  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Field name</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
    <th scope="col">What you need to know</th>

        <li>For mobile devices or tablets, the price can be 0, as the subsidized price with a contract is allowed. For such items, you must include the phrase "only with contract" (or similar) in the title with the product_category value of "Electronics &gt; Communications &gt; Telephony &gt; Mobile Phones" (267) for mobile devices or "Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Tablet Computers" (4745) for tablets.</li>
        <li>For mobile devices or tablets, the price can be 0 when payment options with multiple installments are allowed (US only). For such items, you must include the phrase "with installment plan" (or similar) in the title with the product_category value of "Electronics &gt; Communications &gt; Telephony &gt; Mobile Phones" (267) for mobile devices or "Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Tablet Computers" (4745) for tablets.</li>
