# Import campaigns directly from Facebook Ads

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]    ![Directional arrow from left to right](../images/BA_Conc_Import.svg)
If you already are using Facebook Ads to advertise on Facebook, you can import these campaigns into Microsoft Advertising so that you can run the same ads on Bing. This is an easy way to expand your online advertising reach.

> [!NOTE]
> You can import one Facebook Ads account at a time.
> Some items and settings require special attention during import. Make sure to review [What gets imported from Facebook Ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_Import_FB_WhatInfo.md).

1. If the currencies you set for your Facebook Ads and Microsoft Advertising account do not match, you will see an option to either convert your currency data to match Microsoft Advertising or opt out.
