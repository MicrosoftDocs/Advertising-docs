If you're already using Facebook Ads to advertise on Facebook, you can import these campaigns into Microsoft Advertising so that you can run the same ads on Microsoft Audience Network. This is an easy way to expand your online advertising reach.

> [!NOTE]
> You can import one Facebook Ads account at a time.
> Some items and settings require special attention during import. Make sure to review [What gets imported from Facebook Ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_Import_FB_WhatInfo.md).

1. [!INCLUDE [ImportFacebookAds](./includes/ImportFacebookAds.md)]
1. Select **Sign in to Facebook** and follow the prompts to give Microsoft Advertising permission to import campaigns from your Facebook Ads account.
1. Under **Choose Facebook Ads campaigns**, select the campaigns that you want to import from Facebook Ads. You can choose either to **Import all existing and new campaigns** or to **Import specific campaigns**. If you are choosing specific campaigns, select the checkbox next to each campaign you'd like to import.
1. Select **Continue**.
1. If the currencies you set for your Facebook Ads and Microsoft Advertising account do not match, you will see an option to either convert your currency data to match Microsoft Advertising or opt out. If you choose to opt out, you can manually adjust your bids and budgets using the import options after your import is complete. Select **Convert** to convert the currency data to match Microsoft Advertising or select **Ignore** to opt out of currency conversion. Then, select **Continue**.
1. Under **Choose import options**, choose the items that you want to import and customize.
1. Select **Continue**.
1. Under **Schedule imports**, choose **When** you want to import: Now, once at a later date and time, or on a recurring basis. Scheduling options include **Auto**, **Now**, **Once**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.
1. Select **Schedule** or **Import** to continue.

> [!NOTE]
> On the **Import schedule &amp; history** page, you can run the import again, modify the import schedule, and review logs to see what entities were newly added, updated, or couldnâ€™t be imported.
