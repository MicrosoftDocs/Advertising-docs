# Multimedia ads

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Multimedia ads capture a potential customer's attention with large visual imagery that showcases your brand and products to increase traffic and sales on your website. Multimedia Ads will be shown in distinct mainline and sidebar [ad positions](./hlp_BA_CONC_WhatIsAdPosition.md) and will not replace your text ad placements.

You can create your own multimedia ads with headlines and imagery or you can [apply our recommendations](./hlp_BA_CONC_Recommendations.md).

## Create a new multimedia ad

1. [!INCLUDE [AdsExtensionsAds](./includes/AdsExtensionsAds.md)]
1. Select **Create ad**, and then select an ad group.
1. For **Ad type**, select **Multimedia ad**.
1. Enter the short and long headlines. Headlines are the most prominent text that appears in your ad, so you should make the most out of the available characters. We require multiple headlines so the ad can flexibly display across a variety of publishers and placements.
1. Enter the ad text. This text will appear below or adjacent to your ad's long or short headline depending on the ad placement.
1. Enter your business name.
1. Enter your landing page URL in the **Final URL** box.
1. Select **Add images**. Choose an existing image or upload a new one. At least one image is required. The ad's imagery and overall appearance adjust responsively so it can blend in across a variety of publishers and placements.
