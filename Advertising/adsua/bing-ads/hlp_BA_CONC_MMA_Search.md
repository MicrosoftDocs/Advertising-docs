# Multimedia ads

Multimedia ads capture a potential customer's attention with large visual imagery that showcases your brand and products to increase traffic and sales on your website. Multimedia ads will be shown in distinct mainline and sidebar [ad positions](./hlp_BA_CONC_WhatIsAdPosition.md) and will not replace your text ad placements.

Multimedia ads match your content with potential customers’ searches by mixing and matching the most optimal combinations of headlines, descriptions, and images. You can create your own or apply our Recommendations.

## Create a new multimedia ad

1. [!INCLUDE [AdsExtensionsAds](./includes/AdsExtensionsAds.md)]
1. Select **Create ad**, and then select a standard ad group in a search campaign.
1. For **Ad type**, select **Multimedia ad**.
1. Enter the short and long headlines. Headlines are the most prominent text that appears in your ad, so you should make the most out of the available characters. We require multiple headlines so the ad can flexibly display across a variety of publishers and placements.
1. Enter the ad text. This text will appear below or adjacent to your ad's long or short headline, depending on the ad placement.
1. Enter your business name.
1. Enter your landing page URL in the **Final URL** box.
1. Select **Add images**. Choose from existing images, stock images, or upload a new one. You need to choose at least one image with 1.19:1 aspect ratio and one image with 1:1 aspect ratio. The ad's imagery and overall appearance adjust responsively so it can blend in across a variety of publishers and placements.

## Best practices for multimedia ads

- **Create multimedia ads in existing ad groups.** For optimal performance, we recommend using image assets in all four aspect ratios: 1.91:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 4:1, to analyze performance and drive results.
- **Provide as many assets as possible.** You can provide up to 15 headlines, 4 descriptions, 16 images, and choose from a variety of call to action buttons. We suggest at least 8 to 10 distinct headlines that don’t contain similar phrases. Use a combination of short and long headlines to maximize space on any device. Create headlines that are related to your keywords and use at least one brand title.
- **Make content distinct.** Avoid repetitive language and create varied descriptions. Include additional product or service benefits and features, a clear call to action, and shipping and return information.

## We may make multimedia ad Recommendations for you

Microsoft Advertising may create suggested additional ads for ad groups that appear to be underperforming. [Learn about Recommendations, how you can apply them, and how to opt out](./hlp_BA_CONC_AdsByBing.md).

## Bid adjustments

You can adjust your bids for multimedia ads by specifying a multimedia ad bid adjustment at the campaign or ad group level. Any bid adjustment set for an ad group will take precedence over the campaign bid adjustment. Multimedia ad bid adjustments work the same way as other bid adjustments for Microsoft Advertising campaigns and is a percentage (%) increase on your ad group bids. Multimedia ad bid adjustments can be +20% to +900%. Because multimedia ads don’t compete with other ad types, we recommend a minimum default value bid.
