# Price Extensions: Add prices of your products or services

Price Extensions are a pay-per-click extension that display your products or services, along with their corresponding prices, to searchers. Price Extensions will only show on ads listed at the very top of the results page. This allows searchers to see exactly what they’re looking for when they’re looking for it. This helps to increase your clicks and drive potential customers straight to your converting experiences.

An account, campaign, or ad group can have up to 20 Price Extensions. Like any extension, Price Extensions are free to add to your ad and may not always show for every query. You only pay the standard ad headline cost-per-click for clicks you receive on Price Extensions.

> [!NOTE]
> All Price Extensions are subject to an editorial review to ensure that the listed prices match the price shown on your landing pages. [Learn more](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditProcess.md) about editorial reviews.
