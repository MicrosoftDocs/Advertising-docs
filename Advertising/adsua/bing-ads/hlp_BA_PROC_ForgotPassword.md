# I forgot my user name or password

If you forget the user name or email address that you use to sign in to Microsoft Advertising, you can request that we send you an email with that information. If you forget your password, you’ll need to reset it. For security reasons, we can’t send your password in an email.

## Requesting your user name or email address

1. Go to the Microsoft Advertising sign-in page.
1. Click the link **Forgot your user name?**
1. Next to **I forgot my** select **User name**.
1. Next to **Account email address**, enter the email address that you use as your contact email address for Microsoft Advertising. (The email address that we use to send you information about Microsoft Advertising.)
1. Click **Submit**.

You’ll receive an email from Microsoft Advertising with all of the user names and email addresses associated with the contact email address you provided us. Note that these user names and email addresses might be used to sign in to different customer accounts and, therefore, require different passwords.

If you don’t receive the email, check your junk mail folder.

## Resetting your password

The steps to reset a forgotten password depend on how you are signing in to Microsoft Advertising:

- **Using a Microsoft Advertising user name and password.**  Only customers who signed up before October 2013 and haven’t transitioned to using an email address are still signing in with a Microsoft Advertising user name and password.
- **Using an email address and password (a Microsoft account).** This is [the new way to sign in to Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_MSAFAQ.md). Keep in mind that when you reset your password for your Microsoft account, you reset it for all Microsoft services and devices that you sign in to using that email address (for example, Office365, Skype, OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, Outlook.com).
