## Browser and system settings

We recommend the following settings so that your browser, computer, and Microsoft Advertising work in sync.

## Allow pop-ups
Microsoft Advertising needs pop-ups to be active on your computer. Just turn off your browser's pop-up blocker for the Microsoft Advertising website and allow pop-ups to run. Check your web browser Help for info on how to do that.

## Adjust display settings
For best results, set your screen resolution to 1280 x 960 or higher; 96 dots per inch (DPI). For more information on how to set your display, check the Help for your operating system.

## Disable ad-blocking extensions
Ad-blocking extensions keep the [Ad Preview and Diagonistics Tool](./hlp_BA_PROC_UsingAdPreviewTool.md) from correctly previewing your ads and might cause problems when creating or editing ads. For more information, see [How do I disable ad-blocking extensions?](./hlp_BA_PROC_DisableAdBlock.md)

## Enable JavaScript
You need to activate JavaScript on your browser. Check your web browser Help for info on how to do that.

## Troubleshooting

- Use Microsoft Advertising in private mode (also known as Incognito or InPrivate mode, depending on your browser).
