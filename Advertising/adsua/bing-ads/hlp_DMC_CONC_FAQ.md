To learn more about budgets and billing, check out [Unified Smart campaigns: How budgets work](./hlp_DMC_CONC_Budgets.md) and [Unified Smart campaigns: Credit cards and billing](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CreditCardTroubleshoot.md).

**Can I use Unified Smart campaigns for only search advertising?** 	 	Yes, of course! You can choose to just advertise in Bing and Google without managing your social network presence. You can choose to advertise on Microsoft Advertising  only, or both Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads. The campaign performance is monitored in both platforms and our machine-learning algorithm optimizes the budget allocation to maximize your ad performance.

**How about using Unified Smart campaigns for only social advertising?** 	 	No, we don't offer the option to just run social advertising. You must run search advertising on Bing at a minimum and then optionally you can add social advertising.

**If I already use Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads, can I just use my existing accounts?** 	 	No, you’ll need to use a different email to sign in, and we’ll create new Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads accounts for you.

**If I already have a Facebook Ads account, can I just use my existing account?** 	 	Yes, for social advertising, you must have a Facebook Ads account to begin. Please note that instead of using your Facebook Ads campaigns we'll use new campaigns in Microsoft Advertising.

**Can I import ads, keywords, or targets from my existing accounts?** 	 	No.

**How do automated ads work?** 	 	We'll use Microsoft AI to create automated text ads to be shown in Bing and Google, based on the business info and website URL you provide, as well as text ads that you create. We continuously monitor and make necessary changes to optimize your ad performance.

**Can I turn off automated ads?** 	 	No.

**Can I create my own ads?** 	 	Yes, definitely! Go to the **Ads** page and select the campaign that you want to create ads for. From the **Ad preview** tile, select **View and edit ads**.

**What's the minimum budget amount for search and social advertising?** 	 	The minimum daily budget for advertising campaigns are as follows:

- Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads: $5 USD
- Microsoft Advertising and Facebook Ads: $7 USD
- Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads: $10 USD

**Where can I view my keywords?** 	 	Keywords are out of view and managed for you by Microsoft AI. Keyword themes and performance are taken into account, and we continuously make adjustments to optimize your ad performance.

**What are my targeting options?** 	 	You can adjust your location targets within the United States.

**Can I allocate my budget by channel?** 	 	No, we monitor the performance of all channels and our machine-learning algorithm optimizes the budget allocation to maximize your ad performance.

**How does the billing threshold work?** 	 	We charge your primary payment method when you reach your billing threshold or your monthly billing date, whichever comes first. [Learn more about the billing threshold](./hlp_DMC_CONC_CreditCardTroubleshoot.md).

**Why can't I see my ad on Bing or Google? Are my ads working?** 	 	If you can't find your ad on Bing or Google search results pages, here are some possible reasons:
- You're searching from a location that you have not targeted.
- You're running other ad campaigns in Microsoft Advertising or Google Ads, which are showing instead. The search result pages show only one ad per domain.
- Automated ads created by Microsoft Advertising are showing instead of the ads created by you.
