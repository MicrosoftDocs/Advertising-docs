**Why can't I see my ad on Bing or Google? Are my ads working?**	 	If you can't find your ad on Bing or Google search results pages, here are some possible reasons:
- You're searching from a location that you have not targeted.

- Automated ads created by Microsoft Advertising are showing instead of the ads created by you.
