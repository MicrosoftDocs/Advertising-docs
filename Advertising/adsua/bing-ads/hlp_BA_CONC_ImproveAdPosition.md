# Get my ad to the top of the search results page

Ads that appear in favorable ad positions on the first search results page receive more impressions than those that appear on subsequent results pages.  So, it makes sense to get your ads into those favorable positions. For more info on ad position, see [What is "ad position"?](./hlp_BA_CONC_WhatIsAdPosition.md)

## Here are a few ideas to help you get your ads into those favorable positions

## Increase the relevance of your ad
Make sure your ads are closely related to both your keywords and your landing page. For some tips, see [About improving ad relevance](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutIncreasingAdRelevance.md).
## Increase the relevance of your landing page
Be interesting and avoid gimmicks.
## Write a more effective ad
Speak to your customers, use their language, and be specific. For more suggestions, see [What makes an effective ad?](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutWritingEffectiveAds.md)
## Use the Top vs. other attribute column in account, campaign, ad group, ad, and keyword performance reports
See performance differences (such as CPC and CTR) between mainline and bottom or sidebar ads. This can help you optimize your keyword bids to improve performance and increase your ROI. For info on running a performance report, see [Create a report](./hlp_BA_PROC_CreateReport.md).
## Increase the bid for your keywords, including bid adjustments for targeting
The higher your bid, the more likely you'll outbid others for the same keyword and thus improve your ad's position. Using bid adjustments is a great way to help get the best position. For more information see [How to target my customers by adjusting my bids](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdvancedBidding.md).
> [!NOTE]
> Using bid adjustments can make your final monthly spend greater than the maximum estimated spend. However, if  a customer who does **not** match the target criteria clicks your ad, you do *not* pay any incremental bids.
