Location Extensions in Microsoft Advertising are managed manually, so many use the API, Microsoft Advertising Editor, or bulk update to update Location Extensions in bulk every few weeks. To make it easier, you can set up an automated feed for your location data by linking your Microsoft Advertising account to your Google My Business or [Bing Places](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2110327) account. If you use Location Extensions or Local Inventory Ads, read on to learn how to set up an automated feed for your business location data.

## At a glance

- **Automate Location Extension management** . Stop manually managing Location Extensions.
- **Leverage additional data**  from Google My Business or Bing Places for more products.
- **Get accurate location data**  already verified via Google My Business or Bing Places.

## How do I set up the automated business data feed?
Before you get started, here are a few things to keep in mind:

- The automated feed can only be set up in the UI and you only manage association of Location Extensions in the ad extensions tab. The grid in the Shared Library > Business Data > Business location feed will only display location feed items that have been imported into Microsoft Advertising from Google My Business or Bing Places. If the location is deleted in Google My Business or Bing Places, it will be deleted in Microsoft Advertising as well.
- Once the automated business data feed is set up, the data is refreshed every 24 hours.

1. From the global menu, click **Tools** and then **Business location feed**.
1. Click **Choose import options** and sign in to your Google My Business account.
1. Select the account you want to import and click **Continue**.
1. Optional: Filter import details. When you add a filter, only locations that meet the conditions will be imported to Microsoft Advertising.
1. Click **Import**.

## How do I disconnect from Google My Business or Bing Places?
By deleting the link to your Google My Business or Bing Places account, you'll also be deleting your automated feed set-up. Until you link another Google My Business or Bing Places account, you'll continue to see the previous data, which will continue to be active. If you unlink your account and link to a new one, the previous location data will continue to appear (with a "Deleted" status), along with the new feed data.

1. From the global menu, click **Tools** and then **Business location feed**.
1. Click **Choose import options** and sign in to your Google My Business account.
1. Select the account you want to import and click **Continue**.
1. Optional: Filter import details. When you add a filter, only locations that meet the conditions will be imported to Microsoft Advertising.
1. Click **Import**.
1. Click **Delete** next to your Google My Business or Bing Places account information.
1. Click **OK**.

## How do I create Location Extension associations with my business location data?
1. From the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click **Ads &amp; extensions**.
1. From the top of the page, click **Extensions**.
1. If not already selected, click **Location Extensions** and select **Account**.
1. Click **Create ad extension**.
1. Select the Location Extension you want to add from the **Available Location Extensions** list and and click on +.
1. Click **Save**.
