# Opting out of Automated Extensions

Like regular ad extensions, Automated Extensions add a little spice to your ads, drawing more attention and making your ads more likely to be clicked. Automated Extensions are automatically added to your ads if Microsoft Advertising determines that it can improve your ad performance, but you can also opt out of specific or all Automated Extensions.

## Opt out of Automated Extensions

**Note** : You can only opt out of Automated Extensions at the account level.

1. From the main menu on the left, click **All campaigns**.
1. From the page menu, click **Campaigns** or **Ad groups**.
1. In the table, click the campaign or ad group you want to add an extension to.
1. From the page menu, click **Ads &amp; extensions**.
1. From the top of the page, click **Automated Extensions**.
1. Click **Manage Automated Extensions**.
1. Select **Opt out of specific Automated Extensions** and select the specific extensions to want to remove or select them all.
1. Click **Save**.

If you decide that you want to use Automated Extensions again after you opt out, simply select **Use all Automated Extensions available for this account** and you'll be good to go!

> [!NOTE]
