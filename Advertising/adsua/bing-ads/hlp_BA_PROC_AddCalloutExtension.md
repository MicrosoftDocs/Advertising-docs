# Callout Extensions: Highlight your store's products or offers

Callout Extensions provide an extra snippet of text that highlights your website’s products or offers. This extension is not clickable and can appear in addition to your ad’s description. Providing additional details about your website can make your ad more relevant to potential customers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Callout text may not duplicate what is already stated in the ad. Our full list of Callout Extension policies can be found [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=746651).

Each campaign and ad group can have 20 Callout Extensions associated with it and a minimum of two callouts must be associated with the campaign or ad group for the callout to serve. Keep in mind that your ads won’t always show callouts. If they do, the format may vary. Callout Extensions are free to add to your ad.

**Ability to set up in:** All Bing markets

**Serves in**: All Bing markets, except China.

Callout Extensions can be created or edited at the account, campaign, or ad group level. To select the level you want to make the changes in, select  **Account**, **Campaign**, or **Ad group** below the **Ad Extensions** tab.
