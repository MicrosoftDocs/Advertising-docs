# Billing settings for monthly invoice accounts

As a monthly invoice customer, you can control several aspects of your billing documents, from how they're created to how they're distributed. First, you can enable two global settings that apply to all invoices. Then, you can specify additional settings for invoices grouped by SAP ID, the unique billing number that is assigned to you when you set up monthly invoice billing.

## Global settings

- **Consolidated billing** . If you have multiple monthly invoice accounts, you can combine invoices that share the same Microsoft Advertising manager account number, currency, language, and SAP ID. You'll get a single invoice with a high-level, account-by-account breakdown of costs rather than a separate invoice for each account. (All billing details will remain accessible in Microsoft Advertising.)  At this time, you only have the options to consolidate all monthly invoice bills or none.
- **Campaign details** . You receive a breakdown of costs per campaign with your monthly invoice.

## Consolidate your monthly invoice bills
If you choose to consolidate your invoices, it's all or none. At this time, you can't pick and choose which invoices you can consolidate into one document.

## Include campaign details with your monthly invoice
If you decide to include campaign details with your monthly invoices, it's all or none. At this time, you can't pick and choose which invoices should include campaign details.

## Settings per SAP ID

An SAP ID is a unique billing number that is assigned to you when you set up monthly invoice billing. One or several ad accounts can be organized under an SAP ID. Some larger, more complex businesses will have multiple SAP IDs, each associated to multiple and unique ad accounts. Keep in mind that you will have to specify the following monthly invoice settings for each SAP ID.

## Add an attention line in an invoice
You can route your invoice to a specific person or a department at your company using **Invoice attention**.

## Send paper invoices to a specific mailing address
You can get paper invoices delivered to a different mailing address than your business address, such as an accounts payable department, if your business is based in Korea, Taiwan, China, Colombia, Russia, Peru, Venezuela or Panama. Your business address is the legal business address Microsoft Advertising has on file when your monthly invoice was first set up.

## Manage accounts payable contacts
As designated by a [Super Admin](./hlp_BA_CONC_SSUserRoles.md), an accounts payable contact receives monthly invoices and the Statement of Account, which provides an overview of open invoices and recent payment activity. If there is ever an issue with payment, Microsoft Advertising will use the information on file to reach out to the accounts payable contact.

Super Admins can add anyone as an accounts payable contactâ€”including those without a Microsoft Advertising account. Users without a Microsoft Advertising account receive an email to verify their email address. Upon confirmation, the user is added to the accounts payable contact list.

Email verification is not required for existing users of Microsoft Advertising. Once added to the accounts payable contact list, they'll start receiving billing documents and billing related inquiries.
