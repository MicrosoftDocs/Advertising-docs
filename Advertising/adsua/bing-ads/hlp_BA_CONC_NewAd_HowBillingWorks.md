# Understand your billing options

To understand your billing options, you need to know two things: When you pay (postpay or prepay) and what you pay with (a credit card, Paypal, a check, or bank transfer).

## When you pay

You can pay for Microsoft Advertising campaigns in one of the following ways:

- **Postpay threshold.**  Pay on a regular basis after charges accrue. You pay either on your monthly billing date (the date you sign up for Microsoft Advertising) or when you reach your billing threshold (the maximum amount you can spend on a postpay threshold account before we charge your primary payment method), whichever comes first.
- **Prepay.**  Add funds to your account and have charges deducted from those funds. When you run out of funds, your ads will stop running until more money is added.
- **Monthly invoicing.**  This option is available for qualified customers only. We send you an invoice by email at the beginning of each month for the previous month. Your eligibility is subject to credit approval and if qualified, a credit line will be determined. Once your credit line is determined, you can create an insertion order to manage your monthly spend.

## What you pay with

Your payment method, like a credit or debit card, is what you use to pay your bills. The payment method you can use depends on:

- The currency your account is billed in
- The country of your billing address
- Whether the account is postpay or prepay
