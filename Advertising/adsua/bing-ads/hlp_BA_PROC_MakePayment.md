# Pay your account balance

Want to pay the charges on your postpay threshold account? You don't have to wait until your next billing cycle.

1. [!INCLUDE [ClickBilling](./includes/ClickBilling.md)]
1. Select **Billing summary** from the main menu.
1. To pay the balance on a specific postpay account, use the account selector in the top menu to select that account.
1. Select **Pay account balance**.      If you don't see the **Pay account balance** button, your account balance is too low to do a manual payment through Microsoft Advertising. If you want to pay the balance, you'll need to [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371).

To see the list of currencies and payment methods acccepted for your billing country/region, see [Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising](./hlp_BA_CONC_PaymentMethodsV2.md). And, if you want to review whether a prepay account or a postpay threshold account works best for your needs, see [What are my billing options? Pay now or pay later](./hlp_BA_CONC_HowBillingWorks.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot pay only a portion of your account balance. When you make a payment, your entire account balance is charged to your primary payment method.
