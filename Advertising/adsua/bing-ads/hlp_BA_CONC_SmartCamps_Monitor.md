# Smart campaigns: Monitor your campaign's performance

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

Now that you've [created a smart campaign](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Intro.md), let's see how your ads are performing.

On the **All Campaigns** page, you'll see a tile for each smart campaign you've created. Each tile shows:
- The campaign's name
- The campaign's status (**Enabled** or **Paused**)
- A preview of one of the ads in this campaign

To review the performance of a campaign, or to make changes to it, click either **Campaign details** or the campaign's name in the left pane of the page. On an individual campaign's page, you'll see tiles for:

## Campaign information
Here you'll see your campaign's name, status (**Enabled** or **Paused**), goal, business name, and business website.

To pause a campaign, click the arrow next to **Enabled**, and select **Paused**. To make changes to other details, click **Edit**.
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change a campaign's goal after it has been created.

## Ad preview
Here you'll see a preview of your ad or ads. If this campaign has multiple ads, you can click the arrows on either side of the preview to see them all.

If you want to make changes to any of your ads, click **Edit ads**. [Learn more about crafting effective ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_EffectiveAds.md).

## Clicks
Here you'll see a performance graph showing how many clicks this campaign's ads have gotten over time. Clicks are a good measure of how appealing your ads are to the people who see them. Clicks are also what you pay for—you only pay Microsoft Advertising when someone clicks your ad.
> [!NOTE]
> If you recently created this campaign, you will see "No data available" here.

## Spend
Here you'll see a performance graph showing how much you've spent on this campaign over time. Spend is closely tied to clicks, because clicks are what you pay for.
> [!NOTE]
> If you recently created this campaign, you will see "No data available" here.

## Impressions
Here you'll see a performance graph showing how many impressions this campaign's ads have gotten over time. Impressions are a good measure of how visible your ads are, given your budget, location targeting, and selected products or services.
> [!NOTE]
> If you recently created this campaign, you will see "No data available" here.

## Search phrases
Here you'll see a snapshot of the top words or phrases that people searched for when they saw your ad. To see the complete list, click **Manage search phrases**.

When you review the **Manage search phrases** page, keep your eye out for search phrases that may be irrelevant to your business. Clicks that resulted from these searches are less likely to have helped you reach your goal. To block a search phrase from bringing up your ad in the future, click on its status icon and select **Pause**.
> [!NOTE]
> If you'd like additional search phrases to bring up your ad, expand your products or services (see below).

## Devices
Here you'll see how your clicks, spend, and impressions break down by device type: desktop (including laptops), tablet, and smartphone.
## Locations
Here you'll see a map showing your targeted locations. To make changes to your location targeting, click **Edit locations**.

[Learn more about how your location settings affect who can see your ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Targeting.md).

## Phone calls
Here you'll see a performance graph showing how many phone calls this campaign's ads have resulted in over time, if the campaign's goal is **Get more phone calls to my business**.
> [!NOTE]
> If you recently created this campaign—or if your campaign's goal is not **Get more phone calls to my business**—you will see "No data available" here.

To change your business phone number, click **Edit phone number**.

## Products or services
Here you'll see the business category and the products or services you selected when you created this campaign. To make changes to these settings—or to change the ads' display language—click **Edit products or services**.

[Learn more about how these settings affect who can see your ads](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Targeting.md).

## Budget
Here you'll see the budget you set when you created this campaign. To change your budget, click **Edit budget**.

[Learn more about your budget and what you pay for](./hlp_BA_CONC_SmartCamps_Budget.md).

> [!NOTE]
