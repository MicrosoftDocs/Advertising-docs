# Get email notifications for Microsoft Merchant Center

Sign up to receive email notifications so you don’t miss important information for your Microsoft Merchant Center. You’ll receive the following notifications:

|Notification type|Why it's important|
|---|---|
|Store creation|You’ll receive an email confirming that your Microsoft Merchant Center store is approved and ready, under review, or rejected. We’ll provide you with details on the next steps, depending on your store creation status.|
|Rejected offers|You'll receive an email when we detect high rates of rejected offers in your catalogs. You'll need to check your feed for rejected offers and fix any errors.|
|Upcoming feed expiration|You’ll receive an email to remind you that you have one or more feeds that will expire within 3 days. We’ll provide you details on best practices for keeping your feeds fresh, as well as reminders to upload your feeds at least once every 30 days.|
|Feed expiration|You’ll receive an email when one or more of your feeds have expired, something you’ll want to fix as soon as possible because your product ads aren’t displaying.|
|Automatically download file from URL|If you’re using the **Automatically download file from URL** function, you’ll receive an email if there are any issues with downloading files.|
