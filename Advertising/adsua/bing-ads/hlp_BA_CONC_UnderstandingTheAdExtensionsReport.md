# Understanding the Ad extension report

There are four types of ad extension reports:

- **Ad extension by keyword:**   This report shows performance metrics for all ad extension types and click types, which are ad components that can be clicked (for example, the ad title or driving directions).      You can see how many ad extension impressions youâ€™re receiving for each keyword, and which click type is getting the most clicks and impressions.      When you include the click type column, this report shows you how your ad is performing relative to different ad extensions.
- **Ad extension by ad:**   This report contains the same information as Ad extension by keyword reports, sorted by ads rather than keywords.
- **Ad extension details:**   This report shows performance metrics measured when different ad extensions appear in the ad. That helps you analyze which ad extension gets better impressions and clicks results.
- **Call forwarding details:**   Shows the time and duration of each phone call that originated from a Call Extension that uses the Microsoft Advertising forwarding number. The report helps you understand how the accounts, campaigns, or ad groups are performing with Call Extensions.

## How to create an Ad extension report

1. From the global menu at the top of the page, click **Reports** > **Reports** > **Ad extensions**.
1. Click **Ad extensions**, and then the ad extension report type you want.
1. Select from each list the settings you want for **Show (unit of time)**, **Date range**, and download **Format**. At **What to report on**, if you select **Specific accounts and campaigns**, a box appears for you to select the campaign or account to report on.
1. For **What to report on**, you can choose to see how ad extensions are working on **All accounts and campaigns**, or, if you select **Specific accounts and campaigns**, pick the account you want in the **Available items** box that appears.
1. Under **Choose your columns**, add or remove the columns to set up your report to show what you want.
1. Optionally, you can select a **Filter** to apply to your report.
1. Click **Run** to run the report, or **Download** to download the report as CSV, TSV, or XLSX (Microsoft Excel) file.

> [!NOTE]
> Call forwarding detail reports can also be created on the **Campaigns** page, on the **Dimensions** tab. On the **All Campaigns** page, click the **Dimensions** tab, and then open the list at **Show** and click **Call forwarding detail** (or from the global menu at the top of the page, click **Reports** > **Dimensions** > **Basic** > **Call forwarding**).

## How to read the Ad extension report

Here's an example of some of the data provided in these reports (grouped by extension type), along with a short explanation of what the data means:
