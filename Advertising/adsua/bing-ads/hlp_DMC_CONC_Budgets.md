# Multichannel campaigns: How budgets work

[!INCLUDE [ComingSoon](./includes/ComingSoon.md)]
Tell us how much you want to spend per day on your ad campaign across Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads. Once your daily budgeted amount has been spent, your ads will stop showing until the next day. This way, you only spend as much as you're comfortable with.

The budget amount includes ad spend across Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads. However, the spend on Facebook will be directly billed to you by Facebook. [Learn more about billing options](./hlp_BA_PROC_AddBilling.md).

The minimum daily budget for advertising campaigns are as follows:

- Microsoft Advertising only: $2 USD
- Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads: $5 USD
- Microsoft Advertising and Facebook Ads: $7 USD
- Microsoft Advertising, Google Ads, and Facebook Ads: $10 USD

## Choosing an ad campaign budget

You only pay when someone clicks on one of your ads, so a good way to think about your campaign budget is in terms of clicks and cost per click (CPC). So, how many clicks do you hope to get each day and how much is each click worth to you?

For example, if you want the ads in your campaign to get 50 clicks a day and you decide that each click is worth a maximum CPC of $0.40. Multiply $0.40 by 50 to get a budget of $20 per day.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The budget covers ads on search and social networks. You pay for search ads shown on Microsoft Advertising and Google Ads in Microsoft Advertising. However, Facebook will bill you for social ads shown on Facebook and Instagram.
> Your actual spend per day might be more or less than the target budget you've set. You won't spend more per month than your daily budget multiplied by 30.1.
> Any attempt to change your budget or other ad campaign settings outside of Multichannel campaigns will not be accepted. Update your Multichannel campaigns within Multichannel campaigns.

After your ads begin to appear in search and social networks, you'll be able to see metrics such as the number of impressions and clicks your ads receive. The impressions and clicks will change, based on your budget and targeted locations, giving you an idea of how to update your campaign to maximize your return on investment.
