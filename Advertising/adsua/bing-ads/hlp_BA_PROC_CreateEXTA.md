# How to create or edit expanded text ads

Expanded text ads contain three fundamental visual elements: the ad title (which can have up to three segments), the display URL, and the ad text.

![An example of an expanded text ad.](../images/BA_Misc_ExpandedTextAd.jpg)

You can further enhance your expanded text ad with [ad extensions](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutAdExtensions.md) and [Automated Extensions](./hlp_BA_CONC_AutomatedExtensions.md).

## Create a new expanded text ad
> [!NOTE]
> Before you submit an ad, make sure it meets Microsoft Advertising policies, so it can be active and made available online as quickly as possible. To learn more, see [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md).

1. [!INCLUDE [AdsExtensionsAds](./includes/AdsExtensionsAds.md)]
1. Select **Create ad**.
1. Choose an **Ad group** from the dropdown list.
1. For **Ad type**, select **Expanded text ad**.
1. Enter your landing page URL in the **Final URL** box. **Note** : Your final URL — including prefix (e.g., "www."), suffix (e.g., ".com"), and any [tracking templates](./hlp_BA_CONC_GoogleAnalytics.md)&nbsp;— must be no longer than 2,048 characters. However, your final URL **domain** (everything in your final URL before the first slash or tracking template) must be no longer than 67 characters.
1. Enter three parts of your ad title, each up to 30 characters long. The third title is optional.
1. Similarly, you can also enter two parts of the URL path customers will see in your ad, each up to 15 characters long.
1. Enter the ad text to appear below the path, up to 180 characters long (up to two 90-character descriptions). The second description is optional.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectSave](./includes/SelectSave.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The combined ad title and ad text must be at least three words long.
> These character limits include spaces and any default dynamic text.  [Learn more about dynamic text](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutParameters.md)
> If your final URL includes "http://", these characters do not count against the character limit. However, if it includes "https://", these characters **do** count against the character limit.
> Keep in mind that double-width characters — such as Chinese characters — count as two characters each.
> Ad titles, paths, and ad text cannot contain scripts, HTML, or other markup language.

## Create expanded text ads using Microsoft Advertising recommendations
If you have one or more ad groups that don't contain any active ads, you may receive an email or a notification letting you know we have recommendations for automatically created expanded text ads. The automatically created ads can be based on high-performing ads elsewhere in the campaign, paused ads in the ad group, or other factors. [See if you have any recommendations.](./hlp_BA_CONC_Recommendations.md)

> [!NOTE]
> By using recommendations, you will create basic expanded text ads and have the chance to customize their ad copy. If you want to set up [tracking or URL parameters](./hlp_BA_PROC_UETv2MobileApp.md) for these ads, you will need to edit them in your **Ads** tab.
> Newly-created ads in this ad group will not start running immediately, as they will go through our standard review process. Most reviews are completed within a day.

To get more tips to make your ads more relevant to what users are looking for, see [About improving ad relevance](./hlp_BA_CONC_AboutIncreasingAdRelevance.md). Improving your ads' relevance not only can increase your customer traffic (that all-important click-through rate), but can also improve their position on the Bing, AOL, and Yahoo search results pages and even improve your quality score.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [copy expanded text ads from one ad group or campaign to another](./hlp_BA_PROC_CopyPaste.md).
