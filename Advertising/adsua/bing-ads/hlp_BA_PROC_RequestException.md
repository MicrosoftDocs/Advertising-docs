# How do I challenge a disapproval?

Disapprovals can occur when you create an ad or keyword, or during our editorial review of the components of your ads: ad text, keywords, ad extensions, and ad customizers. For more information about disapprovals, see [How do I fix a Disapproved or Approved Limited status?](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialDisapprovalReasons.md)

If, after reviewing the [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md), you believe that your ad component shouldn't have been disapproved, you can request an exception:

## Request an exception while creating an ad or keyword
1. If an ad or keyword is disapproved as you are creating it, click the **Request an exception** button.
1. In the **Tell us your reason for requesting an exception** box, tell us why you believe the ad or keyword meets the policies and should not have been disapproved, or why the policy in question doesn't apply.
1. Click **Save**.

We'll review the ad component again to ensure the right decision is made. When you submit the request, the [delivery status](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialStatus.md) for the ad component is set to **Exception under review**.

The Microsoft Advertising team responds to requests as quickly as possibleâ€”most reviews are completed within a day. After we've reviewed your request, we'll change the status of the ad component and send you an email summarizing any approvals or disapprovals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that if an ad component is disapproved a second time, the decision is final.
