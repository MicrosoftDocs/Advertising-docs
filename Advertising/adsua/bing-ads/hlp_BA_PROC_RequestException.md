# How do I challenge a disapproval?

Disapprovals can occur when you create an ad or keyword, or during our editorial review of the components of your ads: ad text, keywords, ad extensions, and ad customizers. For more information about disapprovals, see [Fix a Disapproved or Approved Limited status](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialDisapprovalReasons.md).

If, after reviewing the [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md), you believe that your ad component shouldn't have been disapproved, you can request an exception:

## Request an exception while creating an ad or keyword
1. If an ad or keyword is disapproved as you are creating it, select **Request an exception**.
1. In the **Tell us your reason for requesting an exception** box, tell us why you believe the ad or keyword meets the policies and should not have been disapproved, or why the policy in question doesn't apply.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectSave](./includes/SelectSave.md)]

## Request an exception to a disapproval after the editorial review

        <ol>
          <li>From the collapsible menu on the left, select <strong>All campaigns</strong>, and then either <strong>Ads &amp; extensions</strong>  or <strong>Keywords</strong>.</li>
          <li>
						Hover over the ad or keyword disapproved status, and then select <strong>Request an exception for this ad/keyword</strong> or <strong>Request an exception for all ads/keywords in this ad group</strong>.
					  </li>
          <li>
						In the <strong>Tell us your reason for requesting an exception</strong> box, tell us why you believe the ad or keyword meets the policies and should not have been disapproved, or why the policy in question doesn't apply. 
					  </li>
          <li>
						Select <strong>Request an exception</strong>.
					  </li>
        </ol>
      </para>
    </td>
  </tr>

    <th scope="col">Ad extensions and ad customizers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
					  Please [contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371) to request an exception.
					</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We'll review the ad component again to ensure the right decision is made. When you submit the request, the [delivery status](./hlp_BA_CONC_EditorialStatus.md) for the ad component is set to **Exception under review**.

The Microsoft Advertising team responds to requests as quickly as possibleâ€”most reviews are completed within a day. After we've reviewed your request, we'll change the status of the ad component and send you an email summarizing any approvals or disapprovals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that if an ad component is disapproved a second time, the decision is final.
