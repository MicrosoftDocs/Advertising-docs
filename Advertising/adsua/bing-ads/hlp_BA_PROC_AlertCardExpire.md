# Update your credit card expiration date

If your card expires, the card issuer (bank or other financial institution) might decline payment for your account charges. If payment is declined, your ads for the account will no longer be eligible to run unless you have [a backup payment method.](./hlp_BA_CONC_AvailablePaymentMethods.md)

To help you find it, an expired card is marked with a red label that reads "Expired" within the Payment Methods page.    ![Payment method with a label marked "Expired".](../images/BA_ScreenCap_PaymentMethodExpired.png)

There, you can update the expiration date for the card if you want to continue to use that card, or you can use a different payment method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your account might continue to accrue charges even though your card has expired. You can stop additional charges to your account by pausing your campaign on the **Campaigns** page. After you update your card or switch to a different payment method, you will need to enable the campaign so that your ads are eligible to display again.
