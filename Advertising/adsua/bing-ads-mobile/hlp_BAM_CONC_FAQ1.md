## What do I need to use the Microsoft Advertising app iOS?
The Microsoft Advertising app for iOS requires that you have the following:

- iOS 8.0 or later version
- An email address associated to an existing Microsoft Advertising account to sign in to Microsoft Advertising

## How do I sign in and out of the app?
## To sign in with your email address

If you already sign in to an existing Microsoft Advertising account with an email address, use the same Microsoft account email address.

1. Enter the email address you use to sign in to Microsoft Advertising and tap **Next**.
1. Enter your password and tap **Sign in**.

Having trouble signing in? Here are solutions to some of the reasons why you might be having issues:

- **Problem #1** : You’re trying to sign in with a personal account, but your access is blocked.
- **Solution #1** : Some companies only allow access to Microsoft Advertising through a work account, so you may not be able to sign in with a personal email address (like one from Google, Outlook.com, or Yahoo). You will need to work with the super admin for your Microsoft Advertising account on regaining access. [Learn more about signing in with a work account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2131182).

- **Problem #2** : When you try to sign in to the app, you see the following message: "There is no Microsoft Advertising account associated with this email address."
- **Solution #2** : If your company is already using Microsoft Advertising, reach out to the person who manages the account and ask them to invite you as a new user. Once they do, you’ll be able to set yourself up as a user on the account and will then be able to sign in to the app successfully.
