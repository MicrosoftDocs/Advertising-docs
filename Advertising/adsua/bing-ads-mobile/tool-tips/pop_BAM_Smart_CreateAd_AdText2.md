# Ad text 2

**What it is** : The second part of the description that appears below the path in your ad. Ad text 2 is optional.

**Why it's important** : You have more character space to work with in the ad text than in the ad title. So once the ad title has someoneâ€™s attention, the ad text needs to convince them to click it.
