# About responsive search ads

Responsive search ads make creating ads easier by eliminating the need to figure out which headlines and descriptions work well together. You provide up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions, and using these, Microsoft Advertising will mix and match the most optimal combinations to create effective ads for potential customers.

Analyzing ad performance to determine which ads perform best is also taken care of with responsive search ads. The best performing ad combinations are automatically identified and reported to you, while the ineffective ads aren’t shown again. Adapting your ad’s content to match what potential customers are searching for can help to improve your campaign’s performance.

## Best practices for responsive search ads

- **Create responsive search ads with current expanded text ads**  to help avoid impression and click loss when testing effectiveness. In other words, use expanded text ads as a baseline to see how well your responsive search ads are performing.
- **Take advantage of the additional headline limits**  and aim to provide at least 8-10 distinct headlines that don’t contain similar phrases.
- **Take advantage of the additional character limits**  and provide at least two distinct descriptions, with a clear call-to-action for customers.
