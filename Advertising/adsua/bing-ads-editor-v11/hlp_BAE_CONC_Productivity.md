# Productivity tips

To accomplish tasks quickly when working in Microsoft Advertising Editor, use these tips.

## Create multiple campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords with the Multiple Changes Wizard
In the left panel, select the type of item you want to create. For example, campaigns, ad groups, keywords and targeting, or ads and extensions. In the data view, click **Make multiple changes** and then the Multiple Changes Wizard will open.
## Update multiple campaigns, ad groups, keywords and targeting, or ads and extensions from the edit panel
In the data view, select all the items that you want to edit. Then, in the **Edit the selected** pane, update one or more options for all of the selected items.
For example, you can select multiple campaigns, and then update the targeting for all of them. Or, if the URL for a landing page changes, you can revise the destination URL for multiple ads at one time.

## Archive campaign data for quick retrieval
Periodically back up your data by exporting it to an archive file. Regular backups enable you to easily retrieve old data or revert your system to a previous state. For instructions, see [Export campaigns from Microsoft Advertising Editor](./hlp_BAE_PROC_ExportCampaigns.md).
## Copy and paste ads instead of retyping
If you want to use the same ads in multiple ad groups or campaigns, copy and paste the ads instead of retyping them. For instructions, see [Copy ads to another ad group](./hlp_BAE_PROC_CopyAdToAnotherAdGroup.md).
## Use Excel to create or edit campaigns and ad groups
Export an existing campaign or ad group, edit it in Microsoft Excel, and then import it. To create a new campaign from the edited version, specify a new name when you import the edited campaign. For instructions, see [Export campaigns from Microsoft Advertising Editor](./hlp_BAE_PROC_ExportCampaigns.md) and [Importing and exporting with Microsoft Advertising Editor](./hlp_BAE_PROC_Import.md)
