# Delete ad groups

You can easily mark ad groups for deletion, but the deletion is not permanent until you post your changes to Microsoft Advertising.

1. In the left pane, select **Ad groups** and then the campaign that contains the ad group or groups that you want to delete.
1. In the data view, select the ad groups that you want to delete.
1. Right-click on the selected ad groups and click **Delete**. The selected campaigns are now marked for deletion.

> [!NOTE]
> To undo the deletion of one or more ad groups, in the data view, select the ad groups, and then, on the data view toolbar, click **Revert**.
