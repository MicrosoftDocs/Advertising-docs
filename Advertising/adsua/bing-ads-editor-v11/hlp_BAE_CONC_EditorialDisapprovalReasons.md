# My ad or keyword was disapproved. What should I do?

As part of the Microsoft Advertising editorial review process, your ads and keywords are reviewed to ensure that they meet [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BAE_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md). Keywords and ads that don't pass the review process receive a status of **Disapproved**.

Here’s what you can do about it:

## Determine the specific reason for the disapproval
1. In the type list from the left panel, select either **Keywords** or **Text ads**.
1. Click the **View** dropdown and select **Editorial disapprovals** to see all of your disapproved ads or keywords in the data view.
1. Select a disapproved ad or keyword and review the messages in the **Errors** area (between the data view and the edit panel) to find the reason or reasons for the disapproval.

## Consult Microsoft Advertising policies
Review the [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BAE_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md) related to the reasons for the disapproval (see above). Note that the policies may vary depending on the country/region in which the ad is displayed.

## Fix the issue
Click the disapproved item in the data view and then make any necessary edits in either the data view or edit panel. Click **Post** and we will perform a new editorial review on the updated ad or keyword.

## Request an exception
If, after reviewing the [Microsoft Advertising policies](./hlp_BAE_CONC_EditorialGuidelines.md), you believe you were disapproved in error, you can request an exception. With the request, you tell us the reason you want an exception and we will review the ad or keyword again.

1. In the type list from the left panel, select either **Text ads** or **Keywords** and then select **Editorial disapprovals** from the **View** drop-down list.
1. Select the affected ad or keyword in the data view.
1. In the edit panel, enter your reasons why the ad or keyword should be approved in the **Reasons for requesting exceptions to editorial disapprovals** field.
1. Click **Post**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Advertising team responds to requests as quickly as possible -- most reviews are completed within a day. After we've reviewed your request we'll send you a notification summarizing any approvals or disapprovals. You can review the decisions on the **Campaigns** page of Microsoft Advertising.

## My ad was disapproved, but I see other ads with the same issues. Why?
We have many checks in place to identify and remove content that violates Microsoft Advertising policies. If there is content on our network that is in violation of our policies, it’s simply a matter of time before it is found and removed.

If you find content on our network that you believe is in violation of our policies, please report it to us through our [Report Low Quality Ad form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398370). We will review the ad and take action if it violates our policies.
