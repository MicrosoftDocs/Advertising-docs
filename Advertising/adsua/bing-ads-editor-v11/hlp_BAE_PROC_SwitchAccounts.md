# Choose accounts to download to Microsoft Advertising Editor

If you manage multiple Microsoft Advertising accounts, constantly refreshing all their data can be time-consuming. Speed up account management by selecting a smaller set of accounts to update when you upload (post) or downhoad (get) changes.

Changing the account list doesn't affect the data in the accounts, but it can help you:
- **Save time**. With fewer accounts, less information is transferred when you post or get changes.
- **Prevent mistakes**. You can remove similar accounts that might be confused with the one that you are working on. You can always add these accounts to the list again.
- **Focus your account list**. If there are multiple accounts that other people work on, you can select only the accounts that are relevant to you.
- **Make data manageable**. If an account will exceed the Microsoft Advertising Editor limit of 10 GB of downloadable data per user name, you can divide it by getting selected campaigns only.

## Add accounts to get from Microsoft Advertising online
For Windows and Mac:

1. Click **Account** in the menu bar and select **Open account**.
1. In the **Accounts manager** dialog box, select the accounts you want to download to Microsoft Microsoft Advertising Editor, and then click **Open**.
1. In the **Confirm download**dialog box, select the options that you want and then click **OK**.
1. In the **Finished posting** dialog box, click **Close**.
1. Repeat these steps for each additional account that you want to include.

> [!NOTE]
> Because Microsoft Advertising Editor limits the amount of data you can get to 10 GB per user name, you may not be able to get all of your accounts, or all of the campaigns in an account, at one time.

## Remove accounts from your download list
1. Click **Account** in the menu bar and select **Open account**.
1. In **Accounts manager** dialog box, select the account that you want to remove from your download list.
1. Click **Remove**.
