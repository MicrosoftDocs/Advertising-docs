# What is remarketing?

When people look for products and services online, they rarely convert on their first visit. Instead, people visit a site, then they check out competitors, they price compare and sometimes they just get distracted (in no particular order). About 96% of visitors leave websites without converting.

For a first time visitor, an average website has a bounce rate of over 60% and a shopping cart abandonment rate of over 70%. That`s where remarketing comes in. With remarketing, advertisers are able to:

- Appeal to all or a subset of visitors who did not convert and stay top of mind
- Exclude, upsell, or cross-sell to existing customers
- Drive higher ROI (return on investment)

Remarketing in Paid Search lets you improve your return on investment by optimizing your campaigns for specific audiences, which are the people who have visited your website before.

First you create a remarketing list in Microsoft Advertising to define the audience based on actions people take on your website. Then you associate the remarketing list with an ad group and optimize the ad group by adjusting bids.

Before you can target audiences using remarketing lists, you also need to set up Universal Event Tracking (UET) in Microsoft Advertising so that Microsoft Advertising can collect the data from you website.

To learn how to associated a remarketing list with an ad group using Microsoft Advertising Editor, see, [Associate an audience with an ad group or campaign](./hlp_BAE_CONC_Remarketingv2AssociateAdGroup.md).
