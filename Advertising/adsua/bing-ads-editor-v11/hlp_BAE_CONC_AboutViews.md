# Viewing your campaign data the way you want

The data view in Microsoft Advertising Editor provides several predefined views that can help you more easily find specific data related to your campaigns.   For example, you can quickly filter your campaign data to show only those campaigns that have been paused.   Or, you might filter your campaign data to show keywords that have been disapproved through the editorial review process.

If the predefined views aren't showing you the data you want, you can create and save custom views.   These views enable you to define criteria that helps you quickly see the data that you care about the most.

## Add or remove columns in the data view
You can customize the data view to show the specific columns you care the most about.

1. In the type list from the left panel, select **Campaigns**, **Ad groups**, **Keywords and targeting** or **Ads and extensions**.
1. In the data view, click ![Column chooser](../images/BA_ScreenCap_ColumnsIcon.jpg)&nbsp;**Select the columns you want to display**, and then select or clear the column name.
1. To use default columns, click ![Column chooser](../images/BA_ScreenCap_ColumnsIcon.jpg)&nbsp;**Select the columns you want to display**, and then at the end of the menu, select **Reset to default columns**.

## Apply a preset view to your campaign data
