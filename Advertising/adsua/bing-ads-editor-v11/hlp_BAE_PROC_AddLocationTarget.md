# How do I add a location target?

Getting your ad in front of the right people is what targeting is all about. When you target by location, you can choose to show ads to potential customers in all available countries/regions:

- Selected cities and metro areas within the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, and Australia
- Counties within the U.S.
- Postal codes
- County (U.S. only)
- State/Province
- Countries/Regions
- A specified radius around a zip/postal code, coordinates, landmark, or area

Note: Not everyone can target United States counties yet. If you don’t have this feature, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.

Although location targeting is most often used to designate the specific locations where you want to show your ads, Microsoft Advertising also lets you target locations you specifically want to exclude from seeing your ads. (Note: You cannot exclude using radius targeting.)

Not only does Microsoft Advertising let you target customers in a specific location, you can also show ads to customers searching about a specific location. This option is in the **Campaign** tab as **Targeting method**. Take a look at the following examples:

## Example 1

- **Who should see your ads?**   **People in your targeted locations**
- **Target location defined in your campaign:** London
- **Keyword:** Hotels

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Searcher’s physical location</th>
    <th scope="col">Search term</th>
    <th scope="col">Ad eligible for display?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">Florida</th>
    <td>London hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>No</strong>, <strong>not</strong> located in target location
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">London</th>
    <td>Hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Yes</strong>, located <strong>in</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">London</th>
    <td>New York hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Yes</strong>, located <strong>in</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Example 2

- **Who should see your ads?**   **People searching for or viewing pages about your targeted locations**
- **Target location defined in your campaign:** London
- **Keyword:** Hotels

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Searcher’s physical location</th>
    <th scope="col">Search term</th>
    <th scope="col">Ad eligible for display?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">Florida</th>
    <td>London hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Yes</strong>, searching <strong>about</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">London</th>
    <td>Hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>No</strong>, not searching for pages <strong>about</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">London</th>
    <td>New York hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>No</strong>, not searching for pages <strong>about</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Example 3

- **Who should see your ads?**   Both **People in your targeted locations** and **People searching for or viewing pages about your targeted locations**
- **Target location defined in your campaign:** London
- **Keyword:** Hotels

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Searcher’s physical location</th>
    <th scope="col">Search term</th>
    <th scope="col">Ad eligible for display?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">Florida</th>
    <td>London hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Yes</strong>, searching <strong>about</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">London</th>
    <td>Hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Yes</strong>, located <strong>in</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row" style="background:transparent">London</th>
    <td>New York hotels</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Yes</strong>, located <strong>in</strong> target location
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
