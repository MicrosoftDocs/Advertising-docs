# Microsoft Advertising policies

The key to success in online advertising is creating ads that are relevant, clear, and accurate. To help you do just that, we have a detailed [policies website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398341) laying out what makes a great ad and what is and isnâ€™t allowed in an ad.

Every ad and keyword submitted to Microsoft Advertising goes through an editorial review against these policies, so familiarizing yourself with them before you submit can make your approval process much quicker. Think of them as the playbook that'll lead you to victory!
