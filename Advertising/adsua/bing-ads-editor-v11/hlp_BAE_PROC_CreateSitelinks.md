# Create Sitelink Extensions

Sitelink Extensions are additional links in your ads that take people to specific pages on your website. For each campaign, you can enter up to 10 sitelinks. By default, the sitelinks are set at the campaign level, however, you can also set Sitelinks at the ad group level. Specifying sitelinks at the ad group level will override the sitelinks associated with the campaign.

You can now also add up to two lines of descriptive text under each Sitelink Extension. These enhanced Sitelink Extensions can draw attention to your ad by increasing its size. Only high-quality ads at the top of the search results page will trigger enhanced Sitelink Extensions, so make sure you add descriptions to high performing campaigns, such as your brand term campaigns. An ad can display 2, 4, or 6 enhanced sitelinks with descriptions, or 4 or 6 sitelinks in a single row without descriptions, which will be determined by Bing.

**Availability**: All Bing markets

**What you need to know**: In Australia and New Zealand, Sitelink Extensions are available only on the Bing network.
