# Copy ad groups

When you want to create new ad groups that are similar to current ad groups, or create several ad groups at once, you can save time by copying one or more ad groups. The new ad groups can be pasted into any campaign and retain their settings, ads, and keywords.   Or you can copy just the shell of the ad group, which includes settings, but no ads or keywords so you can create new ones.

1. Select the appropriate ad group or ad groups in the data view.
1. Right-click any of the selected ad groups, and then click **Copy** or **Copy ad group shell**.
1. If you want to copy these ad groups into a different campaign, select that campaign from the tree view in the left panel.
1. Right-click in the data view of the campaign that you want to copy the selected ad groups into, and then either:
   1. Select **Paste** to paste copies of the ad groups into this campaign.
   1. Select **Paste excluded websites**, **Paste device targeting**, or **Paste demographics targeting** to paste one of these specific settings.
