# Copy campaigns

When you want to create new campaigns that are similar to current campaigns, or create several campaigns at once, you can save time by copying one or more campaigns. The new campaigns can be pasted into any account and retain their settings, ad groups, ads, and keywords.  Or you can copy just the shell of the campaign, which includes settings, but no ads or keywords so you can create new ones.

1. In the tree view from the left panel, select the account that contains the campaign or campaigns you want to copy.
1. In the data view, select one or more campaigns that you want to copy.
1. Right-click any of the selected campaigns, and then click **Copy** or **Copy campaign shell**.
1. If you want to copy these campaigns into a different account, select that account in the left panel.
1. In the tree view from the left panel, select the account that you want to copy these campaigns into.
1. Right-click in the data view of the account that you want to copy the selected campaigns into, and then either:
  1. Select **Paste** to paste copies of the campaigns into this account.
  1. Select **Paste excluded websites**, **Paste device targeting**, or **Paste demographics targeting** to paste one of these specific settings.
