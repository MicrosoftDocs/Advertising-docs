Each account, campaign, and ad group can have 20 Callout Extensions associated with it and a minimum of 2 callouts must be associated with the account, campaign, or ad group for the callout to serve. Keep in mind that your ads wonâ€™t always show callouts and if they do show callouts, the format it appears may vary. Callout Extensions are free to add to your ad.

Callout Extensions are available in all Microsoft Advertising markets (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan) and serve on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
