# Request an exception to an editorial disapproval

If your ads or keywords have been disapproved, you can request an exception to that decision by following these steps. If your request is denied, the decision is final.

1. In the **View** drop down, select **Editorial disapprovals**. If you only want to see a specific subset of disapprovals, you can select one of the options under **Editorial disapprovals**.
1. In the **Manager** pane, select the ad or keyword that you want to appeal. To request an exception for multiple items at once, select all the items you want to request exceptions for.
1. In the **Reasons for requesting exceptions to editorial disapprovals** field, enter your reasons why the ads or keywords should be approved.
1. Press the TAB key.
1. Click **Post changes** to post your requests.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Advertising team responds to requests as quickly as possible -- most reviews are completed within a day. After we've reviewed your request we'll send you a notification summarizing any approvals or disapprovals. You can review the decisions on the **Campaigns** page of Microsoft Advertising.
