# About ad distribution

Use ad distribution to select where you want your ads to show. You can choose to have your ads shown on the entire search network or subsets of it.

## Ad distribution options

Within the search network, you have additional options. You can choose to have your ads shown on the following:

- **        Only Bing, AOL, and Yahoo owned and operated sites      **
- **        Only Bing, AOL, and Yahoo syndicated search partner sites      ** (these are sites that partner with us to use Bing and Yahoo search results -- see [this article](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398369) for more information)
- **Both**

Ads on the search network may also be displayed in the Bing Smart Search results.

> [!NOTE]
> The ad distribution options **        Bing, AOL, and Yahoo search (owned and operated) only      ** and **        Bing, AOL, and Yahoo syndicated search partners only      ** apply to advertising set up in the following locations: **Australia**, **Austria**, **Canada**, **Denmark**, **Finland**, **France**, **Germany**, **India**, **Ireland**, **Italy**, **Netherlands**, **Norway**, **Spain**, **Sweden**, **United Kingdom**, and **United States** (excluding US territories). These settings will not show when you select outside of these markets, either through ad language selection or targeting. All other locations will use **        All search networks      ** even if the other two options are selected. When you run the Publisher Performance report, you'll see websites based on these ad distribution rules.      To learn how ad language and location targeting affects who sees your ads, see [How does location targeting and ad language affect who can see my ads?](./hlp_BAE_CONC_LocTargetAndLang.md)

## Setting ad distribution

Although you set ad distribution when you create a new campaign, it is an ad-group level setting. Here's how to adjust your ad distribution settings in Microsoft Advertising Editor:

1. Select the ad group in the data view.
1. In the edit panel, change the selection in the **Ad distribution** drop-down list.
1. For the search network, select whether to show your ads on all search networks, just Bing and Yahoo owned and operated sites, or just Bing and Yahoo syndicated search partner sites.
