# Copy targeting settings between campaigns

A fast way to add targeting to a campaign is to copy the targeting settings from another campaign.

1. In the left panel, select the account that contains the campaign with the targeting settings that you want to copy.
1. [!INCLUDE [SelectDataView_Campaigns](./includes/SelectDataView_Campaigns.md)]
1. In the **Manager** pane, right-click the campaign with the targeting settings that you want to copy, and then click **Copy**.
1. If the campaign or campaigns that you want to add targeting to are in a different account than the one currently selected, select that account from the list in the left panel.
1. In the **Manager** pane, select the campaigns that you want to set targeting for.        Right-click one of the selected campaigns, and then click **Paste Special**.
1. In the **Paste Special** dialog box, select the **Targeting** check box, and then click **OK**.
