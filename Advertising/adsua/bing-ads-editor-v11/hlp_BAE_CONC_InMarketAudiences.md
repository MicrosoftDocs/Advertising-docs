# About in-market audiences

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States.

In-market audiences are curated lists of customers who have shown purchase intent signals within a particular category, including searches and clicks on Bing and page views on Microsoft services. Microsoft Advertising supplies the curated list of potential customers, unlike remarketing in paid search, where the advertiser creates the list. You can target and modify bids for these audiences by associating in-market audience lists to ad groups, similar to what you do with remarketing lists.

## Why use in-market audiences?

**Increase conversions**. Reach curated audiences that are more likely to convert in your category.

**Improve bids and targeting**. Set up your ad group to be exclusive to an audience with an in-market audience or available to everyone, but with a bid adjustment for your targeted audience.

**Simple set-up**. In-market audiences are simple to set up and don’t require UET tags.

## How do I select in-market audiences?
1. In the tree view from the left panel, go to **Audiences** under **Keywords and targeting**.

## How do I manage existing in-market audiences?

1. In the data view, click **Add Negative Audience Association**.

**Who shouldn't use in-market audiences?**           If you don’t have customers in one of the available in-market audience categories listed, you shouldn’t use this feature, as you’d be extending your reach to the wrong audience.

**What is the ad delivery behavior when multiple audiences are associated with the same ad group?**           If multiple audiences (for example, remarketing list and in-market audience) are associated with the same ad group and a user qualifies to be part of those multiple audiences, the audience with the highest bid will be applied.
