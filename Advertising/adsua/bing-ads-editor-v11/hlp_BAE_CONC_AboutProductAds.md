# What are Product Ads?

Microsoft Advertising provides two types of ads: Text ads and Product Ads. This article describes Product Ads.

Products Ads include custom images from your  own product catalogs (created in the Microsoft Merchant Center), plus specific promotional  text, pricing, and seller details.

Product Ads use your specific product information  to determine who sees your ads. If someone's  search query is relevant to your products, your  Product Ad can show up on the search results as shown below.

Here are some examples of Product Ads:

This rich visual presentation helps catch  a search user's interest, and helps them make purchase  decisions even before they click your ad.  This can translate into greater engagement, higher  click-through rates, and higher conversion rates.

The process for creating Product Ads is slightly different than what you might be used to when creating a text or mobile ad. Be sure to read [this article](./hlp_BAE_CONC_BSC_GetStarted.md) to learn how to get going.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Shopping Campaigns and product ads are available only in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, India, and Canada (English only and excluding Quebec).
