# Edit campaign budgets

Edit a single campaign budget, or save time by editing multiple campaign budgets at once. You can set budgets to an amount, or increase or decrease them by an amount or percentage.

1. Select the appropriate campaign from the type list in the left panel.
1. In the edit panel, you have the option to:
   - Change your budget amount under **Budget**.
   - If your budget type is **Daily budget**, change the **Daily budget option** from **Standard** to **Accelerated** or vice-versa.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The accelerated budget type is being deprecated for all ad campaign types except audience campaigns. Starting November 1, 2019, all search, shopping, and dynamic search ad campaigns will use standard budget delivery regardless of the budget type that you have set.
