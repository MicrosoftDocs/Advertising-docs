# Delete campaigns

You can easily mark campaigns for deletion, but the deletions are not permanent until you upload your changes to Microsoft Advertising.

1. In the left panel, select **Campaigns** and then the account that contains the campaign or campaigns that you want to delete.
1. In the data view, select the campaigns that you want to delete.
1. Right-click on the selected campaigns and click **Delete**.	 The selected campaigns are now marked for deletion.

> [!NOTE]
> To undo the deletion of one or more campaigns, in the data view, select the campaigns and then, on the data view toolbar, click **Revert**. This restores the campaigns to their most recently synced values.
