# Improvements to Sitelink Extensions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry - it’s coming soon!

Improvements to Sitelink Extensions are here! You can now:

- **Add double the number of maximum sitelinks per campaign or ad group**. Associate up to 20 Sitelink Extensions per campaign or ad group.
- **Manage sitelinks more easily**. Create individual sitelinks and share them across campaigns or ad groups.

Sitelink Extensions are additional links in your ads that take people to specific pages on your website. For each campaign, you can enter up to 20 sitelinks. By default, the sitelinks are set at the campaign level, however, you can also set sitelinks at the ad group level. Specifying sitelinks at the ad group level will override the sitelinks associated with the campaign.

You can now also add up to two lines of descriptive text under each Sitelink Extension. These enhanced Sitelink Extensions can draw attention to your ad by increasing its size. Only high-quality ads at the top of the search results page will trigger enhanced Sitelink Extensions, so make sure you add descriptions to high performing campaigns, such as your brand term campaigns. An ad can display 2, 4, or 6 enhanced sitelinks with descriptions, or 4 or 6 sitelinks in a single row without descriptions, which will be determined by Bing.
