# Resume keywords

If you have paused keywords, you can resume them at any time. Once they are resumed, when the keywords match search queries, your ads will be displayed.

1. Select the campaign or ad group from the tree view in the left panel that contains the keywords you want to resume.
1. In the data view, select the keyword or keywords that you want to resume.
1. In the **Edit the selected keywords** pane, change the **Status** to **Active**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you resume a keyword in an ad group that includes both search ads and content ads, the keyword is resumed for both types of ads.
> You can also pause and resume campaigns, ad groups, and ads.
