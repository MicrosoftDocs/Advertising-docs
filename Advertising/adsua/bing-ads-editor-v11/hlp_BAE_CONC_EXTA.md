# About Expanded Text Ads

Expanded Text Ads are a new, mobile-optimized ad format that enables you to craft longer ad copy and optimize your ad text to better engage with potential customers before they click on your ads. Expanded Text Ads work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, giving you a way to create more compelling calls to action for consumers and drive higher conversions to your business.

Here's how Expanded Text Ads compare to standard text ads:
