# Create ad groups

You can create new ad groups within any existing campaign.

## Create a single ad group
1. In the tree view from the left panel, select the campaign in which you want to create a new ad group.
1. In the data view, click **Add ad group**.
1. In the edit panel, enter the appropriate information in the **Ad group name**, **Start date**, and **End date** boxes. If you don't want the ad group to expire, select the **No end date** check box.
1. In the **Ad distribution** box, select where you want your ads displayed:
   - **Content** network. Microsoft-owned websites, such as MSN Tech & Gadgets, MSN Money, MSN Real Estate, and Windows Marketplace, as well as participating partner websites. When you run your ads on content-based pages, your ads are displayed near relevant content. As a result, you extend your advertising reach to a broader segment of your target audience. Content network ads can be priced using either the cost-per-click (CPC) or the cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) pricing method.
   - **Search** network. Bing, AOL, and Yahoo Search results pages.
   - **Mixed**. Both content and search networks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content network is available only in the United States.

1. In the **Ad rotation** box, select which ads in your ad group will display more frequently:
   - **Optimize for Clicks**. This will predominantly show ads that have the highest click-through rate (CTR).
   - **Rotate Ads More Evenly**. This will rotate between your ads on an equal basis. That is, each ad in a particular ad group has an equal chance of being displayed in response to a searcher's query. Use this option when you want to optimize for conversions instead of CTR, or you're testing new ads. Sometimes the ads that get the highest CTR are not the ads that get the highest conversions. Using this option, you can help ensure that ads with a higher CTR don't unintentionally get precedence over ads with a higher conversion rate. If you want to test new ad copy, using this option can help ensure that those new ads get an opportunity to be displayed, even if you have other ads within the same ad group that have an established and higher CTR performance history.

## Create multiple ad groups
1. In the tree view from the left panel, select the campaign in which you want to create new ad groups.
1. In the data view, click **Make multiple changes** &nbsp; &gt; &nbsp; **Add/update multiple ad groups**.
1. In the **Make multiple changes** dialog box, do one of the following:
   - If your data includes campaign names, check the **My ad group data includes campaign names**.
   - If your data does not contain campaign names, uncheck **My ad group data includes campaign names**, and then, under **Select location**, select the campaigns in which you want to add ad groups.

1. Under **Add ad group data**, do one of the following:				[!INCLUDE [MCWEnterData_Ads](./includes/MCWEnterData_Ads.md)]
1. Click **Next**.
