# View quality scores

Your quality scores indicate the competitiveness of your campaigns in the overall search marketplace. Microsoft Advertising provides a quality score for each of your keywords to help you understand the relevance of your keywords to search users' queries and the degree to which your ads are eligible to be displayed in response to these queries. You can use your quality scores to determine the best way to optimize your keywords, ads, and landing pages, and to help improve your ROI.

1. Select the campaign that contains the keywords whose quality scores you want to view from the tree view in the left panel.
1. Select **Keywords and extensions**, and then **Keywords** from the type list in the left panel.
1. In the data view, click ![Column chooser](../images/BA_ScreenCap_ColumnsIcon.jpg)&nbsp;**Select the columns you want to display**, and then select **Quality score**.
1. In the toolbar, click the down arrow next to **View statistics**, and select the date range for which you want to view quality scores.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to rearrange the columns, click and drag each column to its new position.
> If your ad group is new, there might not be enough data to calculate a quality score. As soon as an ad receives one impression for a keyword, a quality score can be calculated for that keyword. However, you might not see that quality score updated in your account right away.
