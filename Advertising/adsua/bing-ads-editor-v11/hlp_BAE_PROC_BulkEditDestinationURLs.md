You can edit destination URLs, including dynamic text. If a destination URL is used in more than one ad, you can make your edits to multiple ads at the same time.

1. [!INCLUDE [SelectAds](./includes/SelectAds.md)]
1. In the **Edit the selected text ads** pane, in the **Destination URL** box, edit the existing URL or type a new one.
