# About advanced search and filtering

Microsoft Advertising Editor has combined both simple and advanced search into a unified search box directly under the toolbar. Here, you can search an account for items that match the criteria that you specify. Filter suggestions will automatically appear in a drop-down menu, based on what you’re typing.

## Apply filters to narrow your search

Click the search box and select the filter from the drop-down menu that you’d like to apply. You can filter by: Campaign type, bid strategy, ad group status, items with errors, warning type, recommendation type, and many more. Up to 20 filters types can be used at one time.

The tree view and type list in the left pane can also be filtered to show specific kinds of campaigns, ad groups, types, and recommendations.

## Save a search so you can use it again

After entering a search, click the save icon and enter a name for your saved search. To use your saved search, click the search box and select the name of your search. While you can save filters as often as you'd like, we'll always include the 10 most recent ones in the drop down menu on the search bar.

Here are a few ways you can use filters for your searches:
