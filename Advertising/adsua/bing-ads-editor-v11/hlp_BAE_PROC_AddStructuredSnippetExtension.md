# Add Structured Snippets to your ad

Structured Snippet Extensions give potential customers more context on a specific aspect of your products and services. A Structured Snippet is made up of a header and a list of 2-10 values which correspond to the header. For example, you might use the header “Brands:” and the values “Windows, Xbox, Skype” to let customers know about what brands are available at your store.

This extension is not clickable and, similar to other extensions, will appear beneath your ad’s description. Structured Snippets have no impact on the other extensions you’re already using.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Structured Snippets may not duplicate what is already stated in the ad. Our full list of Structured Snippet Extension policies can be found [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=746651).

The maximum amount of Structured Snippets which can be associated to a single campaign or ad group is 20. Keep in mind that your ads won’t always show Structured Snippets and if they do show Structured Snippets, the format they appear may vary. Structured Snippets are free to add to your ad.
