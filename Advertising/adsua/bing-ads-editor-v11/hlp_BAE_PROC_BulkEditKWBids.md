# Edit keyword bids

You can change the bid for a single keyword or make the same change to the bids for multiple keywords.

## Update bid to a specific amount
1. Select the campaign or ad group from the tree view in the left panel.
1. Select **Keywords** under **Keywords and targeting** from the type list in the left panel.
1. Select the keyword you want to edit from the data view.
1. In the **Edit the selected keywords** pane, enter a new bid into the **Bid** box.
Based on Microsoft research, we recommend that you bid at least $0.30 on each keyword. Bids below this are often too low to compete against other advertisers' bids on the same keywords. As a result, your ad might not show.

1. Repeat for each keyword you want to change.

## Increase or decrease bid by a specific amount
1. Select the campaign or ad group from the tree view in the left panel.
1. Select **Keywords** under **Keywords and targeting** from the type list in the left panel.
1. Select one or more keywords you want to edit from the data view.
1. In the **Edit the selected keywords** pane, enter the bid amount.
1. Repeat for each keyword you want to change.

> [!NOTE]
> Once a campaign becomes active, you cannot change its pricing method between CPC (cost per click) and CPM (cost per thousand impressions).
