# Resolving conflicts

Conflicts can result from someone else uploading or making online changes to the campaign you’re changing at the same time in Microsoft Advertising Editor. When you sync with Microsoft Advertising, we’ll alert you immediately if we detect any conflicts. You can then decide which version of the data to keep and resolve any conflicts before you post back to  Microsoft Advertising.

## Resolve all conflicts

1. In the data view, click the drop-down menu.
1. Select either Use data from **Microsoft Advertising Editor** or Use data from **Microsoft Advertising**.
1. Click **Done**.
1. Please note that while this option will resolve all conflicts in the data view, you can still make additional changes in the grid.

## Use data from Microsoft Advertising Editor

You don’t need to do anything. The changes you made in Microsoft Advertising Editor will be applied after you click **Done > Post**.

## Use data from Microsoft Advertising

1. In the data view, click a cell with a conflict.
1. Select the change you made in Microsoft Advertising.
1. Click **Done**.
