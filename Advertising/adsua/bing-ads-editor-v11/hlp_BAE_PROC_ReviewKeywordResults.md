# Review keyword results by month, age, or gender

You can use monthly, age, and gender data to improve your keyword bidding strategy and help increase ad delivery to your target audience. For example, you can:

- Use incremental bids on keywords that are frequently searched for by an age group or gender that you are targeting.
- Increase your bid on certain keywords during months when they tend to perform well.
- Remove keywords that perform poorly with a gender or age group that is important to you.
