# What are Upgraded URLs and how do I upgrade?

If you have set up tracking in Microsoft Advertising Editor by adding URL parameters to your destination URLs, you will be interested in Upgraded URLs.

Upgraded URLs separate the landing page URL from the tracking or URL parameters so if you want to edit your URL parameters, your ad doesn't have to go through another editorial review. It also allows you to define a separate mobile landing page URL if you have a website that is optimized for smaller devices.

The 4 new fields added with Upgraded URLs are **final URL**, **mobile URL**, **tracking template**, and **custom parameters**. A tracking template can be added to an account, campaign, ad group, ad, keyword and Sitelink Extension. When your ad is served the lowest level tracking template will be appended to your landing page URL.

## Benefits of Upgraded URLs

- **More efficient tracking management:**  Manage and update tracking information of multiple URLs with a single shared tracking template. Turn hundreds or thousands of URL edits into one quick change.
- **Less down time; more conversions and clicks:**  Updates to tracking templates don't require an editorial review. This means your ads keep on running, so you donâ€™t lose out on potential conversions.
- **Additional tracking insights:**  Ability to add both URL parameters and custom parameters to your tracking template   to gain additional insights about the source of your ad clicks.

## How to upgrade
