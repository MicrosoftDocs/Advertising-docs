Microsoft Advertising is the only advertising platform (other than LinkedIn) that allows you to target potential customers based on their LinkedIn profile information. You can target customers based on their:

- **Industry** , such as finance, broadcast media, or law enforcement.
- **Job function** , such as sales, accounting, or purchasing.

LinkedIn profile targeting is available for Expanded Text Ad campaigns, dynamic search ad campaigns, and Microsoft Shopping Campaigns.

## What you need to know
- LinkedIn profile targeting will not narrow your ads' audience. For example, by targeting a specific company, you aren't excluding everyone who does not work for that company. If you're familiar with remarketing list targeting, you can think of LinkedIn profile targeting as "bid only", as opposed to "target and bid".
