# How to prevent your ads from showing to certain people

If you want to prevent your ad from appearing in specific locations, on specific web sites within the search network, or prevent your ads from displaying to certain IP addresses, you can configure exclusions.

## To prevent your ads from showing in specific locations
1. In the type list from left panel, click **Locations** and then select the campaigns or ad groups that you want to add location exclusions to.
1. In the **Edit the selected location target** pane:
   - Specify the location for this entry. Click **Edit/find location** and you can specify the location by **Area targeting** (narrow your location target by country/region or city) or by **Radius targeting** (narrow your location to a single mile or kilometer, or expand it to a larger circle).
   - Enter bid adjustment.
   - Select the advanced location option (where you want to show your ad).

1. The details you input will automatically populate the new row in the main grid.

## To prevent specific websites from showing your ads
1. In the tree view from the left panel, select the campaigns or ad groups that you want to add website exclusions to.
1. In the data view, click **Advanced options**, and then click **Exclusions**.
1. Enter (or copy-and-paste) websites that you do not want to show your ads, one website per line (for example, *www.contoso.com*). To exclude your ads from an entire domain, leave off the "www" prefix (for example, *contoso.com*).
1. Click **OK**.
