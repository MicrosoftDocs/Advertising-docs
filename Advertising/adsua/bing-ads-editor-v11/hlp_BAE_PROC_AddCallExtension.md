# What are Call Extensions and how do I add them to my ad?

Manage your existing Call Extensions with Microsoft Advertising Editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Call text may not duplicate what is already stated in the ad. Our full list of Call Extension policies can be found [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=746651).

Call Extensions have the added benefit of allowing you to designate your ads as call only ads. When you select call only ads, website links in your ads are not clickable from a smartphone. Instead, your phone number is the only link that a user can click. Clicking on the phone number link will initiate a call to that number and you will be charged up to your bid amount (just as if the user had clicked on a website link).

With Call Extensions, you have two options: You can use your own phone number or use a Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number. When using a forwarding number, we assign a unique phone number that displays in your ad. When a customer calls this number, the call is routed to your business phone number. Our forwarding number allows you to track all calls from this ad, no matter where the call was made from, so that you can analyze the ad performance.

Call Extensions can be used together with Location Extensions. When these two features are used at the same time, the phone numbers displayed and the availability of click-to-call depend on the device where the ad is being viewed.
