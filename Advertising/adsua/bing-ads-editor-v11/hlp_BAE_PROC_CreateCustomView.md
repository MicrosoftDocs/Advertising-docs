# Create a custom view

You can use the advanced search feature in Microsoft Advertising Editor to perform a customized search for information about your campaigns, ad groups, ads, or keywords, and then save the results in the **View** list as a custom view with a name that you specify.

1. To define the scope of your search, select the appropriate account, campaign, or ad group in the left panel.
1. On the search bar, click **Advanced Search**.
1. Select the status or statuses of the entities you want to find.
1. Under **Add search criterion**, define your search parameters:
  1. In the first drop-down list, select an entity type. The second drop-down list will change depending on your selection.
  1. In the second drop-down list, select the attribute of the entity type you want to search on.
  1. In the third drop-down list, select an operand. Depending on your previous selection, this could be **Equals** / **Does not equal**, **Is greater than** / **Is less than**, etc.
  1. The fourth area will change depending on your previous selections. It could be a field to enter a word or number, a drop-down list of possible options, or a calendar icon to select a date.

1. If you want to further refine your search, click **Add another search criterion**.
1. Select the **Save current search to the View as:** checkbox and give this search a name.
1. Click **Apply**.

To use your custom view, on the **View** list, click the name of the saved search.
