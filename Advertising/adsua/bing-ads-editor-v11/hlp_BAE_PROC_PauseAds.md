# Pause and resume text ads

Whenever you want to temporarily stop running text ads, you can pause them:

When you're ready to make the ads available for display again, you can resume them:

1. From the tree view in the left panel, select the campaign or ad group that contains the ads you want to resume.
1. In the data view, select the ad or ads that you want to resume.
