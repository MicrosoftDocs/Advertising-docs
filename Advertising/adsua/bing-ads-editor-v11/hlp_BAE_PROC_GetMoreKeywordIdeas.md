# Get more keyword ideas

You can potentially increase your impressions and click-through rates by bidding on more keywords, and you can better target your ads by using negative keywords. To find additional keywords and ideas for negative keywords, and then add those keywords or negative keywords directly to your ad groups or campaigns, use the keyword research tools.
