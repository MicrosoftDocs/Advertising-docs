# How does location targeting and ad language affect who can see my ads?

When determining if your ads are eligible to be shown to a particular search user, Microsoft Advertising Editor first determines if your ad language allows for your ad to be shown in a particular country then considers the location target (and other target) settings you have configured. If the target criteria is met and the ad language is available in the country, the ad is eligible to display.

Let’s look at this in a bit more detail. Here are the steps you'd take to determine where your ads are shown:

<table type="type2" style="padding:0px;border-spacing:0px">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">
     ![Step 1](../images/BA_Conc_LocationTargeting_01.png)
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
     ![Step 2](../images/BA_Conc_LocationTargeting_02.png)
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:left">
     ![Step 3](../images/BA_Conc_LocationTargeting_03.png)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align:left; padding-right:18px;">
     The language you set for your ads also determines where those ads can be shown. You can create different ad groups with different languages.
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align:left">
     Choose from:
     <ul><li>All available countries and regions</li><li>Selected cities, metro areas, states/provinces, and countries/regions</li><li>Near a specific business, landmark, zip code or coordinates</li></ul></td>
    <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align:left">
     Choose from:
     <ul><li>Show ads to people in your targeted location</li><li>Show ads to people in, searching for, or viewing pages about your targeted location</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
</table>

**An example:**
<table type="type2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">
     ![Step 1](../images/BA_Conc_LocationTargeting_04.png)
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
     ![Step 2](../images/BA_Conc_LocationTargeting_05.png)
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
     ![Step 3](../images/BA_Conc_LocationTargeting_06.png)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align:left">
     <strong>Result:</strong>  Ads available to show in:
     <ul><li>Germany</li><li>Austria</li><li>Switzerland</li></ul></td>
    <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align:left">
     <strong>Result:</strong>  Ads available to show in Berlin.
     <para><strong>Berlin meets both the language setting and location target.</strong></para></td>
    <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align:left">
     <strong>Result:</strong>  Ads available to searchers physically located in Berlin.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
</table>

## How does my ad language impact where my ads can be seen?
Your ad language setting determines what countries your ad can be displayed in. For example, ads in German will not display in Italy.

This is true even if you have set location targeting to show your ads in “all available countries and regions.” German-language ads, for example, will still only show in countries where German is supported. English-language ads will still only show in countries where English is supported, and so on.

Here are the list of available languages and corresponding countries where that language is supported:

|Ad language settings|Countries/regions where ads in this language can display|
|---|---|
|Danish|Denmark|
|Dutch|Belgium, Netherlands|
|English|Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Vietnam, United Kingdom, United States|
|Finnish|Finland|
|French|Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland|
|German|Austria, Germany, Switzerland|
|Italian|Italy|
|Norwegian|Norway|
|Portuguese|Brazil|
|Spanish|Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Spain, Venezuela|
|Swedish|Sweden|
|Traditional Chinese|Hong Kong S.A.R., Taiwan|

Both the location targeting criteria and the language setting criteria must be met in order for an ad to be eligible for display. Of course your other targeting settings, beyond location, will also have an impact on the determining if the ad should be shown to the searcher.
