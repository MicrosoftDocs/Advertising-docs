**What you need to know**:
- If you already have a 32-bit version of Microsoft Advertising Editor installed, then you will first need to uninstall the 32-bit version (this will delete the downloaded accounts) and then install the 64-bit version. Please note that this will delete your downloaded accounts, so after the installation, you will have to download your accounts again.
- Keep in mind that Microsoft Microsoft Advertising Editor version 11.0 and older Microsoft Advertising Editor version 10 can run side-by-side, so you will need to uninstall 32-bit version of both the applications before you install the 64-bit version.

## Other requirements

- This program is not compatible with Microsoft Excel 2007 (.xlsx files). A future upgrade will enable compatibility with this file type. Meanwhile, you can import data from Excel 2007 files by first saving the data in one of the following formats:
  - Comma-separated values (CSV) file (.csv file extension)
  - Excel 97-2003 Workbook file (.xls file extension)
