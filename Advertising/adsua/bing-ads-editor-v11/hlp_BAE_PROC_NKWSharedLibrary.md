# Eliminate unwanted traffic across campaigns (Negative keyword lists)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Shared negative keywords lists are not available in Microsoft Advertising Editor for Mac just yet. Don't worry, it's coming soon!

An easy way to filter out unwanted traffic is by using negative keywordsâ€”specific words or phrases that help prevent your ad from showing to customers who are unlikely to click your ad.  With a shared library, you can apply entire lists of negative keywords to multiple campaigns. The shared library makes negative keyword management easy because, to make a change across campaigns,  you only have to edit a single list.

## Create a negative keyword list
1. Click **Shared Library** in the left pane and make sure you're in the **Shared negative keywords** view.
1. Click the **Negative keyword lists**.
1. Click **Add negative keyword list** and add the name of your new list in the **Editor** pane.
1. To add negative keywords to the list, click the **Negative keywords in list** tab then **Add negative keyword to list**.

If you already have your list of negative keywords in a spreadsheet, you can add them in bulk by clicking **Make multiple changes**.

## Share your negative keyword list with multiple campaigns
1. Click **Shared Library** in the left pane and make sure you're in the **Shared negative keywords** view.
1. Click **Negative keywords**.
1. Click **Add negative keyword list** and select which negative keyword list and campaign you want to associate.
1. Click **OK**.

To associate the list with another campaign, click **Create negative keyword list association** again, or click **Make multiple changes** to import 		 multiple existing associations via spreadsheet.

## Add, edit, or remove negative keywords from a negative keyword list
1. Click **Shared Library** in the left pane and make sure you're in the **Shared negative keywords** view.
1. Click **Negative keywords**.
1. Click the list name you want to edit.
1. In the **Edit the selected list name** pane below the main grid, click **View and edit ** next to the list name to make changes to negative		 keywords in the list, or to make changes to which campaigns share the list.

## Delete a negative keyword list
1. Click **Shared Library** in the left pane and make sure you're in the **Shared negative keywords** view.
1. Click **Negative keyword**.
1. Click the list name you want to delete.
1. Click **Edit ** on the main toolbar then click **delete**.
