> [!NOTE]
> Each keyword can contain up to 100 characters, including spaces.
> Some common variations of keywords are considered duplicates in your list. Examples of duplicates include instances where the same keyword or phrase is repeated with the addition of articles (*the* and *a*) or punctuation. Microsoft Advertising automatically removes all duplicates from your list, but these variations are still valid keywords for your ads.
> For an ad to go live, its ad group must contain at least one keyword. [!INCLUDE [FollowEditorialGuidelines](./includes/FollowEditorialGuidelines.md)]
