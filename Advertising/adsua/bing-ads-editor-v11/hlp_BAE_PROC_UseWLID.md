# Sign in to Microsoft Advertising Editor with your Microsoft account

Starting in October 2013, new Microsoft Advertising and Microsoft Advertising Editor customers will sign up using a Microsoft account   and existing customers will be asked to transition to a Microsoft account if they haven't already. The transition is optional for now, but is recommended for security reasons.

## Existing users
1. When you sign in to Microsoft Advertising or Microsoft Advertising Editor with your user name and password, you will be given the option to sign in with a Microsoft account.
1. Follow the instructions, or click **Remind me later**.

If you follow the instructions, you will be asked to sign in with an existing Microsoft account or to create a new one.      Once you change to using a Microsoft account for sign in, you can no longer use your Microsoft Advertising user name and password.

If you click **Remind me later**, you will occasionally see the option to sign in with a Microsoft account until you make the transition.

## New customers
1. Go to [Microsoft Advertising sign up](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398308), and click **Sign Up**.
1. Follow the instructions, which include using an existing Microsoft account or creating a new one for your Microsoft Advertising account sign in.
