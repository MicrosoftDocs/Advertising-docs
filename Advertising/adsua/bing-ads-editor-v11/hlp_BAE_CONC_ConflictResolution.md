# About conflict resolution

The conflict resolution feature helps you quickly resolve inconsistencies that result from someone else uploading or making online changes to the same campaign that you are working on in Microsoft Advertising Editor.

When you post or get data, if a conflict is detected between the data in Microsoft Advertising and your local version in Microsoft Advertising Editor, a dialog box appears. Before your task can resume, you must select which version of the data to keep in Microsoft Advertising Editor. You can resolve the conflicts in bulk or individually.

To set default conflict resolution settings...

**For Windows** :

1. Click **Tools** from the menu bar.
1. Select **Options**, then click **Defaults**.
1. Under **User settings**, select what you want to do from the drop-down menu.
1. Click **OK**.

**For Mac** :

1. Click **Microsoft Advertising Editor** from the menu bar.
1. Select **Preferences**, then click **Defaults**.
1. Under **User settings**, select what you want to do from the drop-down menu.
1. Click **OK**.
