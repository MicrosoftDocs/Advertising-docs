# Export campaigns from Microsoft Advertising Editor

You can export the data from a campaign or an ad group to a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

1. Select the campaign or ad group from the tree view in the left panel you want to export.
1. In the data view, right-click the campaign or ad group that you want to export, and then click **Export**.
1. Select what you want to export - the whole account, selected campaigns and ad groups, current campaign and ad group, or current view.
1. In the **Export** dialog box, select the appropriate check boxes and click **OK**.
1. In the **Save As** dialog box, click the folder where you want to save your export file.
1. In the **File name** box, type a name for the export file.
1. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create a new campaign or ad group by changing the campaign or ad group name in the exported data and then importing the data back into your account. Use the Microsoft Advertising Editor bulk editing features to further customize the data for the new campaign or ad group.
> Microsoft Advertising Editor now puts extension settings and association information in separate columns in the CSV export file. This can help shorten the time for exporting campaign data.
> When exporting, all IDs will be enclosed inside square brackets.
