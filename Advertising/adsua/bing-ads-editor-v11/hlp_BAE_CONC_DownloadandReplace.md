# When to use Full Account

The **Full Account** command overwrites all of the data in Microsoft Advertising Editor, including any unsaved changes, with the latest account information from Microsoft Advertising. So use it only when necessary. Here are several scenarios in which you would use the **Full Account** command:

- **The Microsoft Advertising data is the most correct and up to date,** and you don'thave any changes in Microsoft Advertising Editor that will be lost if you restore your account.
- **You've been experimenting with changes in Microsoft Advertising Editor that you want to discard**, and you're not sure that the **Revert** command will undo as many changes as you'd like.
- **You want to overwrite account data that is cached on a shared computer.** You are working on a shared or public computer that has cachedMicrosoft Advertising Editor information that isn't relevant to your work or the accounts that you manage.
- **Your Microsoft Advertising Editor data is damaged ** or corrupted and must be replaced.
