# Pause keywords

When a keyword is paused, it does not trigger the display of ads or accrue charges. When you want to use paused keywords again, you can resume them.

1. Select the campaign or ad group from the tree view in the left panel.
1. Select **Keywords** under **Keywords and targeting** from the type list in the left panel.
1. In the data view, select the keyword or keywords that you want to pause.
1. In the **Edit the selected keywords** pane, change the **Status** to **Paused**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you pause a keyword in an ad group that includes both search ads and content ads, the keyword is paused for both types of ads.
> You can also pause and resume campaigns, ad groups, and ads.
