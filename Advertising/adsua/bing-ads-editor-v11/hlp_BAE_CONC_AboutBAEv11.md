# Welcome to the new Microsoft Advertising Editor!

Microsoft Advertising Editor has been completely redesigned, making it easier to manage your campaigns. We also gave the UI a visual refresh, improving the overall navigation within Microsoft Advertising Editor.

## What's new in Microsoft Advertising Editor?

Here are some of the exciting new features about the latest version of Microsoft Advertising Editor.

## Multi-account support
You can now work on multiple accounts at the same time with Microsoft Advertising Editor . This means that you don’t have to wait for a task to complete in one account before being able to work on a different account! Let’s say you have one account that’s downloading. In the previous version, you had to wait until the download was complete before being able to work on anything else. Now, you can have an account downloading and do bulk edits on another account!

## How do I open multiple accounts?

1. In the Accounts Manager dialog box, click **Add** to add additional accounts.
1. Sign in to your Microsoft Advertising Editor account and click **Yes** to allow access to your Microsoft Advertising information.
1. Select the accounts you want to download and click **OK**.
1. If you already have multiple accounts in the Accounts Manager, select a different account from the one you’re currently viewing, and click **Open**.

Note: If you already have Microsoft Advertising Editor open, click **Account** from the menu bar and select **Open account** to open the Accounts Manager.

## Visual redesign
Microsoft Advertising Editor has a completely new look! A visual redesign has improved the overall navigation, giving it a more user-friendly and familiar experience.

Instead of having separate tabs, you can now drill in to campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords from the left pane. A cleaner toolbar makes it easier to search and to choose columns.

## Copy and paste across accounts
Managing multiple accounts means managing multiple campaigns. You can save time with the ability to copy entities from one account and paste it directly into a different account with Microsoft Advertising Editor . Copy keywords, ads – even whole campaigns – from one account to another with just a couple of right-clicks.

## How do I copy and paste between accounts?

1. Click **Accounts** from the menu bar to open the accounts manager.
1. Select a different account from the one you're currently viewing. If you haven't added additional accounts yet, click **Add** and follow the steps to add another account.
1. Click **Open**.
1. Right-click the item you want to copy from one account to another and click **Copy**. Go the the other account's window, right-click where you want to paste the item to from the left pane, and click **Paste**.
