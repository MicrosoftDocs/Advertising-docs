Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on what's important to you.

## Benefits of using labels
With labels, you could:

- Quickly filter and view performance for keywords labeled “Suggested by Microsoft Advertising.”
- Organize your campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords by adding labels to them and efficiently manage them by filtering on the items with those labels from advanced search.

The important thing is that it’s all up to you. You decide what your labels mean and how to apply them to your campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.

## How to create labels
1. In the tree view from the left panel, select **Labels** under **Share library**.
