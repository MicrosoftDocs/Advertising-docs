# Working offline

You can work on campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords without being connected to the Internet. But you must be connected when you want to upload your changes to your Microsoft Advertising accounts.

An Internet connection is also required when you want to:

- Get changes from your online account.
- Research keywords and negative keywords for your campaigns and ad groups.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have the **Remember my password** option selected, you don't have to sign in again to view Microsoft Advertising Editor information.
> You must get information from Microsoft Advertising at least once before you can work offline in Microsoft Advertising Editor.
