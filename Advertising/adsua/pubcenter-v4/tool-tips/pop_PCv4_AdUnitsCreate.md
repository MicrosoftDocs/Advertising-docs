# Create ad unit

**What it is:**  This is where you define an ad unit.

An ad unit identifies a place on your property (a website with a distinct domain and subdomain) where you want to display one or more ads.

**Tip:**  Double check you have selected the correct publisher and account before creating an ad unit.
