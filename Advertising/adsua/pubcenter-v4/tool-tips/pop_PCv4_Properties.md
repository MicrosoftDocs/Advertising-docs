# Properties

**What it is:** A property is a website with a distinct domain and subdomain. For example, contoso.com, sports.contoso.com and news.contoso.com are separate properties.

All domain paths are considered part of the same property. For example, contoso.com/sports is considered part of contoso.com.

**How to organize**

If you plan to publish the same ad unit on every page, then setting up the whole website as one property is the way to go.

If you want to spend more time and effort managing your account, categorizing media into separate properties might be better.

For example, if you run a news website with separate subdomains for sports, weather, lifestyle, etc., you might want to create a separate property for each one so you can track the performance of different audience demographics separately.
