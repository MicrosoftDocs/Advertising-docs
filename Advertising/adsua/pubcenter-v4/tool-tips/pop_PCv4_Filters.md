# Ad filters

**What it is:**  A filter is a collection of URLs and keywords used to block unwanted ads from appearing on your properties.

For example, if your competitors have an online presence and you don’t want their ads appearing on your property, create a filter that blocks their URLs.

You can also specify keywords that are associated with your competitors' products or services to help ensure that their ads won’t appear.

You can use keywords and URLs to block any content, not only for competitive exclusion reasons but also for content that you find frivolous, unprofessional, or offensive. Enter any keyword to block ads that bid on that word from appearing on your site.

**What you need to know**  For your filter to take effect, you must assign it to a channel associated with an ad unit.
