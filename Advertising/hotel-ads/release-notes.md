# Release notes for Hotel Ads Service

For information about changes that were included with each release, see the following sections.

## March 16, 2021

- Removed support for the QueryControl message.


## June 26, 2020

- Added PropertyPromotionAd as a possible site value to:
  - [SiteMultiplier](..\hotel-service\reference.md#sitemultiplier)
  - [SiteType](..\hotel-service\reporting.md#dimensioncolumns) dimension column
  - [BING-SITE](..\pos-feed\create-pos-feed.md#using-dynamic-query-parameters) dynamic query parameter


## February 14, 2020

- Updated the [Transaction message](../transaction-message/reference.md) doc to reflect that the sum of all [Custom[1-5]](../transaction-message/reference.md#custom1) values is limited to a maximum of 1,000 characters.
- Updated the [PercentageBid](../hotel-service/reference.md#percentagebid) object to reflect that the bid is based on the per night total room rate, which includes taxes and other fees. Previously, the bid was based only on the room rate and did not include taxes and other fees.


## October 9, 2019

- Added PARTNER-ROOM-ID as a possible dynamic query parameter for point of sale URLs. See [Using dynamic query parameters](../pos-feed/create-pos-feed.md#using-dynamic-query-parameters).
- Updated the authentication and app registration details in [Getting started](../hotel-service/get-started.md) and [Getting started with a service](../hotel-service/get-started-service.md).  
  - Bing Advertising continues to support Live Connect but they're encouraging everyone to begin using Microsoft Identity Platform instead.
  - Microsoft changed the portal used to register apps. Instead of using https:\//apps.dev.microsoft.com, you now use [Microsoft Azure App Registration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908).

## September 10, 2019

- Added support for room bundles to [Transaction Message](../transaction-message/reference.md). [Read more](../transaction-message/using-room-bundles.md).  
  - Updates include:  
    - Added the [<PropertyDataSet>](../transaction-message/reference.md#propertydataset-type) element as a child element of the [<Transaction>](../transaction-message/reference.md#transaction) element. Used to specify the room and package metadata for a property.
    - Added the [<PackageData>](../transaction-message/reference.md#packagedata-type) object as a child of \<PropertyDataSet>.
    - Added the [<RoomData>](../transaction-message/reference.md#roomdata-type) object as a child of \<PropertyDataSet>.
    - Added the [<RoomBundle>](../transaction-message/reference.md#roombundle) element as a child element of the [<Result>](../transaction-message/reference.md#result-type) element. Used to specify room types and packages for itineraries.
    - Added the following types used by `RoomData` and `PackageData`:  
      - [OnPropertyCredit](../transaction-message/reference.md#onpropertycredit-type)   
      - [Miles](../transaction-message/reference.md#miles-type)   
      - [MembershipBenefits](../transaction-message/reference.md#membershipbenefits-type)   
      - [PhotoUrl](../transaction-message/reference.md#photourl-type)

      - [Children](../transaction-message/reference.md#children-type)   
      - [Text](../transaction-message/reference.md#text-type)   



## June 13, 2019

- Added conversion tracking metrics to hotel reporting. [Read more](../hotel-service/reporting.md#conversionmetrics).


## April 30, 2019

The following is a documentation-only change.

- Bing Ads is now Microsoft Advertising. Our new name reflects how we're growing our advertising solutions to help you reach more customers. All references to the Bing Ads platform in the documentation were changed to Microsoft Advertising. The brand change does not affect the API at this time. For example, all endpoints remain unchanged.  


## March 8, 2019
- Removed the share of voice ([SOV](../hotel-service/reporting.md#sov)) warning about including the following dimension columns if your request also includes SOV columns. Previously, if you included these dimension columns, the report's data would include duplicate SOV data. This is no longer an issue and you may include these columns with SOV columns.  
  - AdvancedBookingWindow
  - CheckinDay
  - DateType
  - LengthOfStay
  - SiteType
  - SlotType
  - UserCountry 


## December 17, 2018

- Updated the [hotel feed schema](../hotel-feed/reference.md) to include the following [\<listing>](../hotel-feed/reference.md#listingtype) elements:  
  - \<category>
  - \<content>
  

## October 28, 2018

- Added the following [dimension columns](../hotel-service/reporting.md#dimensioncolumns) to reporting. You must not specify these dimensions if your report request includes share of voice (SOV) columns. See [Share of voice](../hotel-service/reporting.md#sov).
  - AdvancedBookingWindow
  - DateType 
  - SiteType


## August 20, 2018

- Updated [Getting sandbox credentials](../hotel-service/get-started.md#getsicredentials) to reflect the current process. Previously, when you signed up for a sandbox account, the process created legacy credentials (username and password). However, the Hotel Ads API requires using a Microsoft account (MSA) for OAuth authentication. This meant you needed to invite a user to work on your account, so you could create an MSA account to use with the Hotel Ads API. This process is no longer required since sandbox now supports only MSA&mdash;you may create a sandbox account using only an MSA and you must sign in using only an MSA.

- Updated information about how to pause hotels. Previously, the documentation said that to pause all hotels in a subaccount, you'd set the subaccount's budget or bid amount to zero (0). Or, to pause all hotels in a hotel group, you'd set the group's bid amount to zero. Same for pausing individual hotels. Instead, to pause hotels, at any level, you must specify a percentage bid and set the percentage bid amount to 0. If you currently specify a fixed bid and you want to pause hotels, you must change the bid to a percentage bid and set its bid amount to zero.

## August 7, 2018

### Nonbreaking change

- Added the following columns to the Performance report. For more information, see [Performance report columns](../hotel-service/reporting.md#performance-report-columns).  
  
  - [Dimension columns](../hotel-service/reporting.md#dimensioncolumns)  
    
    - AdvancedBookingWindow  
    - CheckinDay
    - DateType  
    - SiteType  

- Changed the UserCountry dimension to reflect the country where the user is located instead of the publisher's country. Prior to August 2, 2018, UserCountry contains the publisher's country. After August 2, 2018, UserCountry contains the user’s country.

## May 3, 2018

## March 5, 2018

### Nonbreaking change

- Added the [IncludeNonPerformingHotels](../hotel-service/reference.md#includenonperforminghotels) field to the [ReportJob](../hotel-service/reference.md#reportjob) object.

## October 15, 2017

Released the Beta version of Hotel Ads.

### Nonbreaking changes

- Added the following ways to send Bing your transaction messages.  
  - Pull requests  
  If you sign up for pull requests, Bing sends the endpoint that you specify a [Query](../query-message/query-message.md) message that specifies the itinerary data that you should send back in a [Transaction](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md) message. With this option, you provide Bing all of your itinerary data.  
  - Pull with hints requests  
  If you sign up for pull with hints requests, Bing sends the endpoint that you specify a Query message that specifies the itinerary data that you should send back in a Transaction message. However, the query message specifies only the itinerary data that you said changed in your [Hint](../hint-message/hint-message.md) message. 
  
- Added the following messages to support the two types of pull requests.  
  - QueryControl message  
  - [Hint](../hint-message/hint-message.md) message
  - [Query](../query-message/query-message.md) message

### Hotel API

- Added the `BidMultiplierSource` field to the [Hotel](../hotel-service/reference.md#hotel) and  [HotelGroup](../hotel-service/reference.md#hotelgroup) objects. The source field indicates whether the object inherits or defines the bid multipliers. For example, if hotel object inherits the multipliers from the subaccount, `BidMultiplierSource` is SubAccount.  
  
- Added support for the [$select](../hotel-service/reference.md#select-param) OData query parameter. You can use the parameter to select the fields that you want the response to include.
