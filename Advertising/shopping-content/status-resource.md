# Status Resource

The Status resource lets you get the status of product offers that you uploaded to the specified catalog. After you upload offers to the catalog, they go through a validation and editorial review process. This process can take up to a 36 hours. The offer is included in the report only after it completes the review process.

For an overview of how the process works, see [How Do I Get the Status of Product Offers?](../shopping-content/how-get-status-product-offers.md)

For a code example that shows how to get the catalog's status and download the report, see [Downloading the Catalog Status Report](../shopping-content/code-examples.md#status).
