# Content API Overview

Content API is a RESTful API that lets advertisers programmatically manage their [Microsoft Merchant Center](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51083/1) catalogs. Content API is an alternative to managing your catalog using the Microsoft Merchant Center web page or by using FTP. Content API has the following advantages:

-   Provides the ability to update product offers incrementally rather than uploading the entire data feed. Being able to update a subset of your products is more efficient than having to upload the entire feed by using FTP.

-   Provides the ability to make changes to product pricing and availability to reflect close to real-time market conditions. For example, if your product goes out of stock, you can quickly update its Availability field using the Content API.

-   Provides the ability to batch together large numbers of items to process in a single request. A batch operation can include inserts, deletes, and updates. Using batch operations is a more efficient use of resources than using single operation calls (for example, a single insert operation).

-   Provides the ability to download catalog status reports.

-   Provides the ability to manage your catalogs programmatically.


## Who Should Use the API?

You should consider using the Content API if:

-   You are currently using the Google Content API. 

-   Your feed includes a large number of products.

-   You are able to integrate the Content API with the rest of your inventory management systems.

If your catalog is small, or you have a limited ability to integrate with your inventory systems, you may be better off using one of the other methods for uploading your catalog (see [Submit your feed file](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51086/1)).
