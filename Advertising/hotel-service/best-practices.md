# Best practices for Hotel Service API

This section lists best practices that you should consider when building your application.

## Retrieving hotels

Do not use the following calls to download all of your hotels. Instead, to retrieve all hotels, use the reporting feature (see [Reporting](reporting.md)). These calls are meant only for users paging through hotels in a user interface.

- [SubAccounts('{subAccountId}')/Hotels](reference.md#listallhotels)
- [SubAccounts('{subAccountId}')/HotelGroups('{hotelGroup}')/Hotels](reference.md#listhotels)
- [SubAccounts('{subAccountId}')/Ungrouped](reference.md#ungrouped)
