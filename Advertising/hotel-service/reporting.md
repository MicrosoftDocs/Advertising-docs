# Hotel Ads Reporting API

> [!NOTE]
> This beta release of Hotel Ads is available to select participants only. For information about participating in the beta release program, please contact your account manager.

> The API and documentation are subject to change.

Reporting is an asynchronous process. The following is the general flow for requesting a report.

- Create a request with the report parameters
- Send a request to the reporting service
- The service queues the request until it's able to process it
- Poll the service periodically to get the status of the report job
- When the status is Completed, use the URL that the service provides to download the report.

For an example that shows how to request and download a report, see [Reporting code example](code-example-reporting.md).

## Requesting a report

To request a report, send an HTTP POST request to the following endpoint (for the sandbox endpoint, see [Endpoints](reference.md#endpoints)):

`https://partner.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Travel/v1/Customers({customerId})/Accounts({accountId})/ReportJobs`

The body of the request is a [ReportJob](reference.md#reportjob) object. You must specify the following fields in the request:

- StartDate&mdash;The start of the reporting period
- EndDate&mdash;The end of the reporting period
- Columns&mdash;The columns to include in the report
- ReportType&mdash;The type of report or entity to download

All other fields are optional.

The lowest granularity available is daily (hourly is not supported). If `Columns` includes the Date column, the report contains rows for each day in the `StartDate` and `EndDate` window, inclusively. If you don't include Date, the report data shows the total performance summary for the specified start and end dates.


The following example shows a `ReportJob` request for a performance report.

```json
{
    "ReportType":"Performance", 
    "StartDate":"2017-11-06", 
    "EndDate":"2017-11-13", 
    "Columns":[  
        "HotelId", 
        "Clicks" 
    ] 
}
```

By default, the service generates reports in uncompressed CSV format. To compress the report and improve download performance, include the [Compression](reference.md#compression) field and set it to ZIP.

The response to the POST contains a report job ID (see [AddResponse](reference.md#addresponse)). For example:

```json
{
    "value":"1080"
}
```


## Polling for the status of a report job

After getting the ID, use it to get the status of the report job. To get the status, send an HTTP GET request to:

`https://partner.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Travel/v1/Customers({customerId})/Accounts({accountId})/ReportJobs('{jobId}')`

The report job is valid for an undetermined amount of time after it completes but typically for at least seven days. After seven days, you should submit a new report request.

The body of the response is a [ReportJob](reference.md#reportjob) object. To determine the job's status, access the `Status` field. When the job finishes, `Status` is set to Completed and the `Url` field contains the URL that you use to download the report. The URL is valid for seven days. If the URL expires, you must submit a new job request. 

How long it takes for report jobs to finish is undetermined and is based on several variables that are constantly changing such number of jobs in the queue, amount of data, and size of reporting period. Generally, you should poll for the status of the job every five seconds until the job's status is Completed or Failed. 



## Downloading the report

When the report job's status is Completed, the job's `Url` field contains the URL that you use to download the report. To download the report, send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.

When you use the download URL to download the report, don't specify the Authorization header like you do with the other report requests; simply use the download URL.

For uncompressed reports, the GET response's Content-Type header contains text/csv. For compressed reports, the header contains application/zip.

If you asked the service to compress the report's data (see the report job's `Compression` field), the service places the file in a folder and uses ZIP compression to compress the report. Remember to uncompress the folder before accessing and reading the report. The name of the report file is auto-generated and has the form, performance-\<request ID\>.



## Filtering report data

To filter the data in the report, use the[ReportJob](reference.md#reportjob) object's `Filter` field. You may filter the report on the following dimension columns and any [measure column](#measure-columns). The column names are case sensitive.

- SubaccountId
- SubaccountName
- HotelGroupId
- HotelGroupName
- HotelId
- HotelName
- HotelStatus
- PartnerHotelId
- DeviceType

Using filters is an AND operation. For example, if you filter on HotelPartnerId equal to 123 and DeviceType equal to Mobile, the report contains data only where the partner's hotel ID is 123 AND the device type is mobile.

To filter a report's data, set `Filter` to an OData [$filter](http://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/#queryData) string. The following example shows how to filter the report for ads shown on desktops and tablets. The enumeration values that you use in the filter are case sensitive. For example, use Desktop instead of desktop.

```json
{
    "ReportType":"Performance", 
    "StartDate":"2017-11-06", 
    "EndDate":"2017-11-13", 
    "Columns":[  
        "HotelId", 
        "Clicks" 
    ], 
    "Filter":"DeviceType eq Enum.DeviceType'Desktop' or DeviceType eq Enum.DeviceType'Tablet'", 
}
```

In addition to using the `Filter` field, you can use the `SubaccountId` and `HotelGroupId` fields to limit the report to a specific subaccount or hotel group. Using these fields to limit the scope to a single subaccount or hotel group provides better performance than using `Filter`. If you use `SubaccountId` and `HotelGroupId`, don't also specify them in the filter.


## Including non-performing hotels in the report

By default, the performance report contains only hotels that have impressions during the reporting period. To include hotels that did not have impressions during the reporting period, set the [IncludeNonPerformingHotels](reference.md#includenonperforminghotels) field in the report request to **true**.

```json
{
    "ReportType":"Performance", 
    "StartDate":"2017-11-06", 
    "EndDate":"2017-11-13", 
    "Columns":[  
        "HotelId",
        "PartnerHotelId",
        "Clicks",
        "Impressions"
    ],
    "IncludeNonPerformingHotels" : true
}
```

If you request non-performing hotels in the report, the `columns` property must not include the following [dimension columns](#dimensioncolumns):

- Date
- DeviceType
- HotelCountry
- LengthOfStay
- SlotType
- UserCountry

If the `columns` property includes any of the above fields, the report jobs request fails.

### How does IncludeNonPerformingHotels affect reporting for hotels that moved groups?

By default, the report includes hotel performance data for the hotel no matter whether you segment the report by hotel, hotel group, or subaccount. Moving the hotel from one group to another does not impact the default reporting behavior. For example, if the report includes the hotel column, the report includes all performance data for the hotel during the specified time period. 

```
Date        Hotel ID   Clicks
1-1-2018    5678       12
```

If you include the hotel column and hotel group column, the report includes hotel performance data that occurred for each hotel group during the specified time period.

```
Date       Hotel group ID   Hotel ID   Clicks
1-1-2018   1234             5678       2
2-1-2018   9876             5678       10
```

But things change if you include the IncludeNonPerformingHotels request property. If true, the report includes performance data for only active hotel and hotel group associations. This means that the hotels report example above changes to:

```
Date        Hotel ID   Clicks
1-1-2018    5678       10
```

And the hotel group example changes to:

```
Date       Hotel group ID   Hotel ID   Clicks
2-1-2018   9876             5678       10
```



## Books closed

For information about when books close, see [Determining when books close](/advertising/guides/reports#booksclose). Determining when books close for Hotel Ads is the same as for Microsoft Advertising campaigns with the following exceptions:

- Hotel Ads' reporting service uses the account's time zone.
- Hotel Ads' reporting service doesn't support ReturnOnlyCompleteData.


## Performance report columns


Reports contain [dimension](#dimension-columns) columns and [measure](#measure-columns) columns (metrics). The metric data is segmented by the dimension columns. This means that the metric data rolls up to the lowest-level dimension in the dimension hierarchy that you specify in your report request.

The following is the dimension hierarchy for Performance Report.

1. Date
1. SubaccountId/Name
2. HotelGroupId/Name
3. HotelId/Name, PartnerHotelId
4. HotelCountry
5. UserCountry
6. SlotType
7. LengthOfStay
8. DeviceType

For example, if the request contains SubaccountId and Clicks, the clicks roll up to SubaccountId.

|Date|Subaccount|Clicks
|-|-|-
|2017-11-16|123|40

And if the request contains SubaccountId, HotelGroupId, and Clicks, the clicks roll up to HotelGroupId. 

|Date|Subaccount|Hotel group|Clicks
|-|-|-|-
|2017-11-16|123|987|12
|2017-11-16|123|654|13
|2017-11-16|123|321|15


The request must include at least one dimension column and one measure column.

> [!NOTE]
> SOV data is available beginning May 1, 2018. If you specify a reporting period that includes dates prior to May 1, 2018, the SOV fields will contain a zero (0) value for dates prior to 1 May.



### <a name="conversionmetrics"></a> Conversion metrics

> [!NOTE]
> Conversion tracking is available to select participants only. For information about participating in the conversion tracking pilot, please contact your account manager or send email to hahotline@microsoft.com.

You can track bookings at the hotel, hotel group, or subaccount level. But before you can track bookings, you must add a hotel conversion tracking UET tag to each POS website. For general information about UET tags, see [Everything you need to know about setting up UET](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56913/2-500).

#### Steps to get started

- Ensure each POS website has a JavaScript [UET](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56682/0) tag for the customer ID (CID) you're using for hotel ads.
- The supported [goal types](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56709/2) that you can use are Custom Event and Destination URL. You can reuse an existing goal or create a new one, but it must use variable revenue tracking.
- Ask your account manager to enable you for hotel ads conversion tracking.
- After you're enabled, edit your UET tag to begin reporting booking information.
- Verify you tag is working properly by using the [UET Tag Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uet-tag-helper-by-bing-ad/naijndjklgmffmpembnkfbcjbognokbf?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog).


#### UET tag variables

|Variable|Required|Description
|-|-|-
|hct_total_price|Yes|The total price of the booking, including taxes and fees.
|hct_base_price|Yes|The price of the booking, not including taxes and fees.
|currency|Yes|The currency of your conversion goal.
|hct_checkin_date|Yes|The booking's checkin date in the form, YYYY-MM-DD.
|hct_checkout_date|Yes|TThe booking's checkout date in the form, YYYY-MM-DD. Not required if you specify hct_length_of_stay.
|hct_length_of_stay|Yes|The number of nights the booking is for. Not required if you specify hct_checkout_date.
|hct_partner_hotel_id|Yes|The ID that you used to identify the hotel in your hotel feed.
|hct_booking_xref|Yes|The encrypted or obfuscated booking reference number.


#### Example UET tag

The following example shows a [custom event](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56684/2) UET tag. The example hard codes the values for simplicity.

```javascript
window.uetq.push('event', 'my_hotel_event_action', {​
    'hct_total_price': 188,​
    'hct_base_price': 165,​
    'currency': 'USD',​
    'hct_checkin_date': '2018-10-27',​
    'hct_length_of_stay': 4,​
    'hct_partner_hotel_id': 'example_hotel',​
    'hct_booking_xref': 'X2N5531APZ'​
});​
```

To preview example events being fired in real-time, see [Reporting hotel conversion events](http://bingadsuet.azurewebsites.net/HotelConversions.html)


After adding a UET tag to your websites, you can start including the following list of conversion tracking metrics in your report request.

- [Conversions](#conversions)
- [ConversionRate](#conversionrate)
- [CPA](#cpa)
- [GrossRevenue](#grossrevenue)
- [GrossRevenuePerClick](#grossrevenueperclick)
- [GrossRevenuePerConv](#grossrevenueperconv)
- [GrossROAS](#grossroas)
- [NetRevenue](#netrevenue)
- [NetRevenuePerClick](#netrevenueperclick)
- [NetRevenueConv](#netrevenueconv)
- [NetROAS](#netroas)
- [TotalBookedNights](#totalbookednights)
- [AvgBookedNights](#avgbookednights)
- [BookedABW](#bookedabw)
- [AvgBookedABW](#avgbookedabw)


The following guidelines apply to hotel conversion tracking.

- Microsoft Advertising supports a conversion window of up to 90 days. You specify the conversion window in the Microsoft Advertising web app.
- Bookings are counted as conversions. The number of conversions does not account for cancellations (they're not tracked).
- To specifying whether to track all conversions or only unique conversions, see the Microsoft Advertising web app.



## Sample Performance report

The following shows an example of the report's header rows and columns.

```
"Performance report (October 30, 2017 - November 29, 2017)"
Request Id: f11b6610-5b85-4d7f-97ad-69668eb9da11

Date,Subaccount ID,Hotel group ID,Clicks,CTR,Impr.,Spend,User country
```

The first header row contains the report's name and requested reporting period. The second header row contains the report's request ID. If there's a problem with the report, you'd use the ID when you contact support to get help with the issue.

> [!NOTE]
> IDs such as the hotel ID or ad group ID are enclosed in square brackets (for example, [1234567890]).
