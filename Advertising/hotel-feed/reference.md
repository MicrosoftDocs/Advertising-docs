> This beta release of Hotel Ads is available to select participants only. For information about participating in the beta release program, please contact your account manager.

If you create hotel ads in Bing, you must use a hotel feed to provide Bing information about the hotels that you advertise. You must define and import your hotel feed prior to sending Bing [Transaction Messages](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md). 

For information about creating a hotel feed, see [Creating a Hotel Feed](../hotel-feed/create-hotel-feed.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The elements must be specified in the order defined by the [Hotel XSD](https://bhacstatic.blob.core.windows.net/schemas/hotelv2.xsd) (and as listed in this topic).
