# Transaction Message reference

> [!NOTE]
> This beta release of Hotel Ads is available to select participants only. For information about participating in the beta release program, please contact your account manager.

If you create hotel ads in Bing, use transaction messages to provide Bing your itinerary data. This section describes the elements of a transaction message defined by the [Transaction XSD](https://bhacstatic.blob.core.windows.net/schemas/transaction.xsd). 

For information about creating a transaction message, see [Creating a Transaction Message](../transaction-message/create-transaction-message.md).

For information about sending a transaction message, see [Pusing a Transaction Message to Bing](../transaction-message/push-transaction-message.md) or [Having Bing Pull Transaction Messages](../transaction-message/pull-transaction-message.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Bing does not support all Transaction XSD elements. This topic includes only those elements and attributes that Bing supports. Bing ignores all other elements and attributes. 

> [!NOTE]
> The elements must be specified in the order defined by the Transaction XSD (and as listed in this topic).

## Transaction

Defines the top-level element of a transaction message.

|Element|Description|Children
|-|-|-
|Transaction|The top-level element in a transaction message.<br /><br />Attributes:<ul><li>timestamp&mdash;Required. The UTC date and time that you sent the message. The time stamp format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[+/-hh:mm]. The UTC offset is optional. For example, 2017-06-14T08:00:34 or 2017-06-14T01:00:34+07:00.<br /><br />The time stamp applies to each itinerary in the message. Bing processes an itinerary only if the time stamp is later than the time stamp of the same itinerary stored in Bing. For example, if Bing processes a message with time stamp 14:10 and then processes a message with time stamp 14:09, only those itineraries not included in the 14:10 message are processed.<br /><br />Messages with a time stamp older than 24 hours are not processed.</li><li>id&mdash;Required. An opaque, user-defined ID that advertisers use to uniquely identify the message. The transaction status report includes this ID.</li></ul> |[Transaction Type](#transactiontype)

 
<a name="transactiontype" /> 

## Transaction Type

Defines the transaction message.

|Element|Description|Children
|-|-|-
|Result|Required.<br /><br />The `Transaction` element must contain one or more `Result` elements. Specify one `Result` element for each itinerary (`Checkin` and `Nights` combination) that you specify for a property. The amount of data that you specify for each `Result` object determines the number of itineraries that you may specify. However, the size of the list plus the `Transaction` element must be less than 100 MB (or 10 MB compressed). |[Result Type](#resulttype)
