# Transaction Message reference

> [!NOTE]
> This beta release of Hotel Ads is available to select participants only. For information about participating in the beta release program, please contact your account manager.

If you create hotel ads in Bing, use transaction messages to provide Bing your itinerary data. This section describes the elements of a transaction message defined by the [Transaction XSD](https://bhacstatic.blob.core.windows.net/schemas/transaction.xsd). 

For information about creating a transaction message, see [Creating a Transaction Message](../transaction-message/create-transaction-message.md).

For information about sending a transaction message, see [Pushing a Transaction Message to Bing](../transaction-message/push-transaction-message.md) or [Having Bing Pull Transaction Messages](../transaction-message/pull-transaction-message.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Bing does not support all Transaction XSD elements. This topic includes only those elements and attributes that Bing supports. Bing ignores all other elements and attributes. 

> [!NOTE]
> The elements must be specified in the order defined by the Transaction XSD (and as listed in this topic).

## Transaction

Defines the top-level element of a transaction message.

|Element|Description|Children
|-|-|-
|Transaction|The top-level element in a transaction message.<br /><br />The message must include either the \<PropertyDataSet> element, \<Result> element, or both. But because the metadata (\<PropertyDataSet>) doesn't change often, you typically create a separate transaction message for it and another transaction message for itineraries (\<Result>), which are updated more frequently.<br /><br />Attributes:<ul><li>timestamp&mdash;Required. The UTC date and time that you sent the message. The time stamp format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[+/-hh:mm]. The UTC offset is optional. For example, 2017-06-14T08:00:34 or 2017-06-14T01:00:34+07:00.<br /><br />The time stamp applies to each itinerary in the message. Bing processes an itinerary only if the time stamp is later than the time stamp of the same itinerary stored in Bing. For example, if Bing processes a message with time stamp 14:10 and then processes a message with time stamp 14:09, only those itineraries not included in the 14:10 message are processed.<br /><br />Messages with a time stamp older than 24 hours are not processed.<br /></li><li>id&mdash;Required. An opaque, user-defined ID that advertisers use to uniquely identify the message. The transaction status report includes this ID.</li></ul> |[Transaction Type](#transaction-type)


## Transaction Type

Defines the transaction message.

|Element|Description|Children
|-|-|-
|PropertyDataSet|Optional.<br /><br />A container object that contains the metadata for rooms and packages. Use `RoomData` to describe the physical description of a type of room (for example, non-smoking, single queen room). And use `PackageData` to describe different packages of amenities (for example, you can have one package that includes breakfast and another that doesn't). Specify a property data set for each property that you want to define metadata for.|Array of [PropertyDataSet Type](#propertydataset-type)
|Result|Optional.<br /><br />Defines an itinerary. An itinerary is a unique combination of the `Checkin` and `Nights` elements. Specify one `Result` element for each itinerary that you define for a property. The number of itineraries that you may specify is limited by the size of the `Transaction` element, which must be less than 100 MB (or 10 MB compressed). |Array of [Result Type](#result-type)
