# UserInvitation Data Object - Customer Management
Defines an invitation for a user to sign up for Microsoft Advertising. The invitation limits account access and permissions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the invitation is sent, you can opt to limit user access to a subset of advertiser accounts that are directly under your customer. If an [agency hierarchy](../guides/account-hierarchy-permissions.md#agency-hierarchy) is setup (now or in the future) under the customer where the user is invited, and if you do not limit access to specific accounts, the user will have access to all accounts in the hierarchy. 

It is possible to have multiple pending invitations sent to the same email address, which have not yet expired. It is also possible for those invitations to have specified different user roles, for example if you sent an invitation with an incorrect user role and then sent a second invitation with the correct user role. The recipient can accept any of the invitations, and can sign up with credentials that differ from the invitation email address. Microsoft Advertising users can accept invitations to multiple customers with the same credentials. For more information, see the [Multi-User Credentials](../guides/account-hierarchy-permissions.md#multi-user-credentials) technical guide.

You can search for pending invitations by [invitation ID](senduserinvitation.md#userinvitationid) and find out whether or not the invitation has been accepted or has expired. The [SearchUserInvitations](searchuserinvitations.md) operation returns all pending invitations, whether or not they have expired. Accepted invitations are not included in the [SearchUserInvitations](searchuserinvitations.md) response.  

After the invitation has been accepted, you can call [GetUsersInfo](getusersinfo.md) and [GetUser](getuser.md) to access the Microsoft Advertising user details. However, since a recipient can accept the invitation and sign up with credentials that differ from the invitation email address, you cannot determine with certainty the mapping from a [UserInvitation](userinvitation.md) to a [User](user.md) or [UserInfo](userinfo.md) object. With the user ID returned by [GetUsersInfo](getusersinfo.md) or [GetUser](getuser.md), you can call [DeleteUser](deleteuser.md) to remove the user as needed. The Bing Ads API does not support any operations to delete pending user invitations. After you invite a user, the only way to cancel the invitation is through the Microsoft Advertising web application. You can find both pending and accepted invitations in the **Users** section of **Accounts & Billing**.
