# About dynamic search ads page feeds

Page feeds allow you to easily upload all the relevant URLs for your dynamic search ads campaigns in a spreadsheet format. This ensures maximum website coverage and enables the labeling and targeting of specific URLs via custom labels.

Why use page feeds for dynamic search ads?

- **Improve page freshness**: Each time a feed is uploaded, the pages in the feed automatically recrawled, so if the pages aren’t already in the Bing index of your website, they’ll be added. This allows your dynamic search ad campaigns to display the most current version of your website.
- **Fine-tune auto-targets and ad copy**: You have full control over what pages are included in an auto-target and as a result, can be more descriptive in your ad copy to drive further engagement.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Dynamic search ads are available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.

## Create a page feed file

You can download the page feed template or create a .csv, .tsv, .xls, or .xlsx file that contains the following two columns:

|Column|What it is|What you need to know|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|Page URL|Contains the URLs of your website to include in the feed.|Enter one URL per row.|
|Custom label (optional)|Labels that allow you to group the URLs within the feed.|Enter one or more labels per row, separated by a semicolon.<br/><br/>A maximum of 10 custom labels can be added per feed item (row).|
|Ad title (optional)|Static headline that is shown instead of Microsoft's dynamically generated headline.|Enter an ad title (maximum 63 characters) for the page feed item. You can include one ad title per feed item.|

> [!NOTE]
> You can have 100 feeds per account (this maximum number includes all feed types) and the maximum number of feed items (rows) per account is 5 million.
