# KeywordPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [KeywordPerformanceReportRequest](keywordperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|<a name="adgroupstatus"></a>AdGroupStatus|The ad group status.|
|<a name="adid"></a>AdId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an ad.|
|<a name="adrelevance"></a>AdRelevance|How closely related your ads is to the customer's search query or other input. It tells you how relevant your ad and landing page are to potential customers. A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score. Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
|<a name="adtype"></a>AdType|The ad type.|
|<a name="assists"></a>Assists|The number of conversions from other ads within the same account that were preceded by one or more clicks from this ad. An ad is considered to have assisted the conversion if it was clicked before the most recently clicked ad that was credited with the conversion. Additionally, the click corresponding to the assist must occur  within the conversion period of the goal.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16. The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|<a name="averageposition"></a>AveragePosition|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|<a name="bidmatchtype"></a>BidMatchType|The keyword bid match type. This can be different from the *DeliveredMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="bidstrategytype"></a>BidStrategyType|The bid strategy type. Possible values include *EnhancedCpc*, *ManualCpc*, *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, and *TargetCpa*.

For more information, see [Microsoft Advertising click measurement: description of methodology](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/microsoft-advertising-click-measurement-description-of-methodology).|
|<a name="conversionrate"></a>ConversionRate|The conversion rate as a percentage. The number of conversions, divided by the total number of clicks. For example, if the ads in your campaign got 300 clicks and four conversions, the conversion rate is 1.33 (%). The formula for calculating the conversion rate is *(Conversions / Clicks) x 100*.|
|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|<a name="costperassist"></a>CostPerAssist|The cost per assist. The formula for calculating the cost per assist is *(Spend / Assists)*.|
|<a name="costperconversion"></a>CostPerConversion|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*. Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|
|<a name="ctr"></a>Ctr|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%). The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) x 100*.|

|<a name="expectedctr"></a>ExpectedCtr|How well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. Ads that are relevant to searchers' queries or other input are more likely to have a higher click-through rate. This metric tells you if a keyword is underperforming and causing a loss in impression share, so you can make keyword changes or remove ads altogether. A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed.

The score for each row is the score that was calculated for expected CTR on that date. For example, if you specify a time period that spans three days, the Historical expected CTR score for day one will be the expected CTR score calculated on day one, the Historical expected CTR score for day two will be the expected CTR score calculated on day two, and so on.
