# KeywordPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [KeywordPerformanceReportRequest](keywordperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.<br/><br/>If you include this column, then you may not include restricted attributes such as [TopVsOther](#topvsother) in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, then you must exclude this column. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions).|

|<a name="qualityimpact"></a>QualityImpact|The numeric score that indicates the possible increase in the number of impressions that the keyword could receive if the corresponding *QualityScore* column would rise above underperforming:0 - Not available. Could be because the keyword is not underperforming.1 - Low impact. Improving the quality score could increase impressions by less than 100 additional impressions per day.2 - Medium impact. Improving the quality score could increase impressions by 100 to 500 additional impressions per day.3 - High impact. Improving the quality score could increase impressions by more than 500 additional impressions per day.|
|<a name="qualityscore"></a>QualityScore|The numeric score shows you how competitive your ads are in the marketplace by measuring how relevant your keywords and landing pages are to customers' search terms. The quality score is calculated by Microsoft Advertising using the *ExpectedCtr*, *AdRelevance*, and *LandingPageExperience* sub scores. If available, the quality score can range from a low of 1 to a high of 10. Quality score is based on the last rolling 30 days for the owned and operated search traffic. A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more. Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day. If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period. Use the Historical quality score to find out how quality score may have changed over time. Historical quality score is a daily snapshot of the rolling quality score.  For more information on Historical quality score, see the *HistoricalQualityScore* column.|
