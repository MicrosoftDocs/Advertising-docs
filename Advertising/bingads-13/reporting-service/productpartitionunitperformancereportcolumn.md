# ProductPartitionUnitPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [ProductPartitionUnitPerformanceReportRequest](productpartitionunitperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|<a name="adstatus"></a>AdStatus|The ad status.|
|<a name="assistedclicks"></a>AssistedClicks|Clicks on your ads that have received co-bids from your manufacturer partners. Clicks are what you pay for.<br/><br/>Clicks typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers).<br/><br/>This performance statistic is only applicable for cooperative shopping campaigns.|
|<a name="assistedconversions"></a>AssistedConversions|Conversions resulting from the clicks on your ads that have received co-bids from your manufacturer partners.<br/><br/>This performance statistic is only applicable for cooperative shopping campaigns.|
|<a name="assistedimpressions"></a>AssistedImpressions|The number of times an ad that is being co-bid by your manufacturer partners has been displayed on search results pages or other sites on the Microsoft Advertising Network.<br/><br/>This performance statistic is only applicable for cooperative shopping campaigns.|
|<a name="assists"></a>Assists|The number of conversions from other ads within the same account that were preceded by one or more clicks from this ad. An ad is considered to have assisted the conversion if it was clicked before the most recently clicked ad that was credited with the conversion. Additionally, the click corresponding to the assist must occur  within the conversion period of the goal.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16. The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|<a name="bidmatchtype"></a>BidMatchType|The keyword bid match type. This can be different from the *DeliveredMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="bidstrategytype"></a>BidStrategyType|The bid strategy type. Possible values include *EnhancedCpc* and *ManualCpc*. If the InheritFromParent strategy type is used, the report will include the inherited bid strategy type e.g. one of the supported values listed above.|

For example, if the ads in your campaign got 300 clicks and four conversions, the conversion rate is 1.33 (%). The formula for calculating the conversion rate is *(Conversions / Clicks) x 100*.|
|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|<a name="costperassist"></a>CostPerAssist|The cost per assist. The formula for calculating the cost per assist is *(Spend / Assists)*.|
