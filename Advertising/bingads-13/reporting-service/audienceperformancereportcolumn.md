# AudiencePerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AudiencePerformanceReportRequest](audienceperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks
### <a name="requiredcolumns"></a>Required Columns
The report must include the following columns. As a general rule, each report must include at least one non-impression share attribute column and at least one performance statistics column. For more information, see [Report Attributes and Performance Statistics](../guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The TimePeriod column is expected for all aggregation types except Summary. It is important to note that if you do not include TimePeriod, the aggregation you chose will be ignored and Summary aggregation will be used regardless.
