# AudiencePerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AudiencePerformanceReportRequest](audienceperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|<a name="accountnumber"></a>AccountNumber|The Microsoft Advertising assigned number of an account.|
|<a name="accountstatus"></a>AccountStatus|The account status.|
|<a name="adgroupid"></a>AdGroupId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an ad group.|
|<a name="adgroupname"></a>AdGroupName|The ad group name.|
|<a name="adgroupstatus"></a>AdGroupStatus|The ad group status.|
|<a name="associationstatus"></a>AssociationStatus|The status of the association between the ad group and remarketing list, which indicates whether ads are eligible to display. The possible values are Active, Paused, and Deleted.|
|<a name="audienceid"></a>AudienceId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of the audience, for example the remarketing list ID.|
|<a name="audiencename"></a>AudienceName|The audience name.|
|<a name="audiencetype"></a>AudienceType|The audience type.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16. The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|<a name="averageposition"></a>AveragePosition|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|<a name="bidadjustment"></a>BidAdjustment|This attribute reflects the current value of your ad group's audience bid adjustment, even if a different bid adjustment value was used when the ad was shown. This value is the requested percentage to increase or decrease the bid amount for the remarketing list.|
|<a name="campaignid"></a>CampaignId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of a campaign.|
|<a name="campaignname"></a>CampaignName|The campaign name.|
|<a name="campaignstatus"></a>CampaignStatus|The campaign status.|
|<a name="clicks"></a>Clicks|Clicks are what you pay for. Clicks typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers). For more information, see [Microsoft Advertising click measurement: description of methodology](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/microsoft-advertising-click-measurement-description-of-methodology).|
|<a name="conversionrate"></a>ConversionRate|The conversion rate as a percentage. The number of conversions, divided by the total number of clicks. For example, if the ads in your campaign got 300 clicks and four conversions, the conversion rate is 1.33 (%). The formula for calculating the conversion rate is *(Conversions / Clicks) x 100*.|
|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|<a name="costperconversion"></a>CostPerConversion|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*. Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|
|<a name="ctr"></a>Ctr|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%). The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) x 100*.|
|<a name="impressions"></a>Impressions|The number of times an ad has been displayed on search results pages. Without impressions there are no clicks or conversions.|
|<a name="returnonadspend"></a>ReturnOnAdSpend|The return on ad spend (ROAS). The formula for calculating the ROAS is *(Revenue / Spend)*.|
|<a name="revenue"></a>Revenue|The revenue optionally reported by the advertiser as a result of conversions.<br/><br/>Available for accounts that are setup to use analytics with Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking. For more information, see the [Track sales and other conversions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=624771) help topic.|
|<a name="revenueperconversion"></a>RevenuePerConversion|The revenue per conversion. The formula for calculating the revenue per conversion is *(Revenue / Conversions)*.|
|<a name="spend"></a>Spend|The cost per click (CPC) summed for each click.|
|<a name="targetingsetting"></a>TargetingSetting|This attribute reflects the current value of your ad group's audience targeting setting. The possible values are "Target and bid" or "Bid only". Target and bid: Show ads only to people included in the remarketing list, with the option to change the bid amount. Bid only: Show ads to people searching for your ad, with the option to change the bid amount for people included in the remarketing list.|
|<a name="timeperiod"></a>TimePeriod|The time period of each report row. You may not include this column if the *Aggregation* element of the request object is set to Summary. For more information, see [Time Period Column](../guides/reports.md#timeperiod).|
