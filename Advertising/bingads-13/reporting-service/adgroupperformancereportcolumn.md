# AdGroupPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AdGroupPerformanceReportRequest](adgroupperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|Value|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionsharepercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionSharePercent|The number of times your ad is shown in the top position as a percentage of the total available impressions in the market you were targeting.<br/><br/>Reports on impression highlight information about how many impressions you're missing in the top slot and why. You can use this data to inform you about making changes to get more impressions, increase the likelihood of more clicks on those ads, and as a result, increase the likelihood of more sales.<br/><br/>If you include this column, then you may not include restricted attributes such as [TopVsOther](#topvsother) in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, then you must exclude this column. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions).|
|<a name="accountid"></a>AccountId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an account.|
|<a name="accountname"></a>AccountName|The account name.|
|<a name="accountnumber"></a>AccountNumber|The Microsoft Advertising assigned number of an account.|
|<a name="accountstatus"></a>AccountStatus|The account status.|
|<a name="addistribution"></a>AdDistribution|The network where you want your ads to show.|
|<a name="adgroupid"></a>AdGroupId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an ad group.|
|<a name="adgrouplabels"></a>AdGroupLabels|The labels applied to the ad group.<br/><br/>Labels are delimited by a semicolon (;) in the report download.|
|<a name="adgroupname"></a>AdGroupName|The ad group name.|
|<a name="adrelevance"></a>AdRelevance|How closely related your ads is to the customer's search query or other input. It tells you how relevant your ad and landing page are to potential customers. A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score. Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
|<a name="assists"></a>Assists|The number of conversions from other ads within the same account that were preceded by one or more clicks from this ad. An ad is considered to have assisted the conversion if it was clicked before the most recently clicked ad that was credited with the conversion. Additionally, the click corresponding to the assist must occur  within the conversion period of the goal.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16. The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|<a name="averageposition"></a>AveragePosition|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|<a name="bidmatchtype"></a>BidMatchType|The keyword bid match type. This can be different from the *DeliveredMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="campaignid"></a>CampaignId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of a campaign.|
|<a name="campaignname"></a>CampaignName|The campaign name.|
|<a name="campaignstatus"></a>CampaignStatus|The campaign status.|
|<a name="campaigntype"></a>CampaignType|The campaign type.<br/><br/>Possible values include *Audience*, *Dynamic search*, *Search*, and *Shopping*.|
|<a name="clicks"></a>Clicks|Clicks are what you pay for. Clicks typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers). For more information, see [Microsoft Advertising click measurement: description of methodology](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/microsoft-advertising-click-measurement-description-of-methodology).|
|<a name="clicksharepercent"></a>ClickSharePercent|The percentage of clicks that went to your ads. It is the share of the prospective customer's mindshare and buying intent you captured. You can use this performance metric to see where your growth opportunites are.<br/><br/>For example, your click share percent is 30% if 10 ads were clicked, and three of the 10 ads were yours.<br/><br/>If you include this column, then you may not include restricted attributes such as [TopVsOther](#topvsother) in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, then you must exclude this column. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions).|
|<a name="conversionrate"></a>ConversionRate|The conversion rate as a percentage. The number of conversions, divided by the total number of clicks. For example, if the ads in your campaign got 300 clicks and four conversions, the conversion rate is 1.33 (%). The formula for calculating the conversion rate is *(Conversions / Clicks) x 100*.|
|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|<a name="costperassist"></a>CostPerAssist|The cost per assist. The formula for calculating the cost per assist is *(Spend / Assists)*.|
|<a name="costperconversion"></a>CostPerConversion|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*. Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|
|<a name="ctr"></a>Ctr|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%). The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) x 100*.|
|<a name="currencycode"></a>CurrencyCode|The account currency type. For possible values, see [Currencies](../guides/currencies.md).|

|<a name="deliveredmatchtype"></a>DeliveredMatchType|The match type used to deliver an ad. This can be different from the *BidMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="deviceos"></a>DeviceOS|The operating system of the device reported in the *DeviceType* column. The possible values include *Android*, *Blackberry*, *iOS*, *Other*, *Unknown*, and *Windows*. If the operating system of the device cannot be determined or is not one of the operating systems that you can target, the value in this column will be *Unknown*.|
|<a name="devicetype"></a>DeviceType|The device name attribute of a device OS target bid. The type of device which showed ads. The possible values include *Computer*, *Smartphone*, *Tablet*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="exactmatchimpressionsharepercent"></a>ExactMatchImpressionSharePercent|The estimated percentage of impressions that your ad group received for searches that exactly matched your keyword, out of the total available exact match impressions you were eligible to receive.<br/><br/>Reports on exact match impression share highlight how your keywords perform only on those searches that exactly match your keywords. Use this data together with impression share to diagnose your non-exact match keywords, and make changes to be more competitive and gain more impressions.|
|<a name="expectedctr"></a>ExpectedCtr|How well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. Ads that are relevant to searchers' queries or other input are more likely to have a higher click-through rate. This metric tells you if a keyword is underperforming and causing a loss in impression share, so you can make keyword changes or remove ads altogether. A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed.

The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed.|
|<a name="historicalexpectedctr"></a>HistoricalExpectedCtr|Historical average of expected click-through rate scores going back as far as 18 months from the current date. This score may vary from the score in the *ExpectedCtr* column, which is the current score and same value for each day in the time period. The score for each row is the score that was calculated for expected CTR on that date. For example, if you specify a time period that spans three days, the Historical expected CTR score for day one will be the expected CTR score calculated on day one, the Historical expected CTR score for day two will be the expected CTR score calculated on day two, and so on. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed. You may include this column only with Daily aggregation.|
|<a name="historicallandingpageexperience"></a>HistoricalLandingPageExperience|Historical average of landing page experience scores back as far as 18 months from the current date. This score may vary from the score in the *LandingPageExperience* column, which is the current score and same value for each day in the time period.

The quality score is calculated by Microsoft Advertising using the *ExpectedCtr*, *AdRelevance*, and *LandingPageExperience* sub scores. If available, the quality score can range from a low of 1 to a high of 10. Quality score is based on the last rolling 30 days for the owned and operated search traffic. A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more. Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day. If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period. Use The historical quality score to find out how quality score may have changed over time. Historical quality score is a daily snapshot of the rolling quality score.
