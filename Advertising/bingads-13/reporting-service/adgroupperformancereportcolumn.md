# AdGroupPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AdGroupPerformanceReportRequest](adgroupperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Some coloumn combinations are not allowed in the same report request. For example, if you include the [AbsoluteTopImpressionRatePercent](#absolutetopimpressionratepercent) column, then you may not include restricted attributes such as [TopVsOther](#topvsother) in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, then you must exclude this column. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions).  

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|Value|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionratepercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionRatePercent|How often your ad was in the first position of all results, as a percentage of your total impressions.<br/><br/>A higher number indicates your ad is frequently showing in the best ad position.<br/><br/>The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionsharelosttobudgetpercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionShareLostToBudgetPercent|The estimated percentage of how often your ad missed showing in the very top ad position, above search results, due to insufficient budget.<br/><br/>This indicates where increasing your budget might improve your chances at the top ad position, which is more likely to win clicks and conversions.<br/><br/>The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionsharelosttorankpercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionShareLostToRankPercent|The estimated percentage of how often poor ad rank kept your ad from showing in the first ad position at the top of search results.<br/><br/>Use this data to help you assess reasons your ads are missing out on the top ad position, which is more likely to win clicks and conversions. Ad rank determines where your ad shows relative to other ads, based on factors including your bid amount, ad performance, ad relevance, ad extensions, other competing ads, and more.<br/><br/>The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionsharepercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionSharePercent|The estimated percentage of times your ad was in the first position of all ads shown, out of the total impressions available in the market you were targeting.<br/><br/>A low number means your ads are less likely to win clicks and conversions, because they rarely appear in the first position. This might indicate you need to increase your bid or budget.<br/><br/>The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.<br/><br/>Prior to April 20, 2019 this performance statistic was only calculated for Microsoft Shopping campaigns.|

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score. Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
|<a name="allconversionrate"></a>AllConversionRate|The conversion rate as a percentage.<br/><br/>The number of conversions, divided by the total number of clicks.

|<a name="exactmatchimpressionsharepercent"></a>ExactMatchImpressionSharePercent|The estimated percentage of impressions that your account received for searches that exactly matched your keyword, out of the total available exact match impressions you were eligible to receive.<br/><br/>Reports on exact match impression share highlight how your keywords perform only on those searches that exactly match your keywords. Use this data together with impression share to diagnose your non-exact match keywords, and make changes to be more competitive and gain more impressions.<br/><br/>The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.|

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. The score is calculated only based on Search Traffic. The value in the report will be "--" (double dash) if the score was not computed.
