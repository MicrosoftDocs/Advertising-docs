# ProductDimensionPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [ProductDimensionPerformanceReportRequest](productdimensionperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|Value|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionratepercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionRatePercent|How often your ad was in the first position of all results, as a percentage of your total impressions.<br/><br/>A higher number indicates your ad is frequently showing in the best ad position.<br/><br/>The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. Neither *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation are supported. If you include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will not return an error and you should ignore any performance data returned for this column.|
|<a name="absolutetopimpressionsharepercent"></a>AbsoluteTopImpressionSharePercent|The number of times your ad is shown in the top position as a percentage of the total available impressions in the market you were targeting.<br/><br/>Reports on impression highlight information about how many impressions you're missing in the top slot and why. You can use this data to inform you about making changes to get more impressions, increase the likelihood of more clicks on those ads, and as a result, increase the likelihood of more sales.<br/><br/>If you include this column, then you may not include restricted attributes such as [TopVsOther](#topvsother) in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, then you must exclude this column. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions).|
