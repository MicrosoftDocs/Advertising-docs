# AdDynamicTextPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AdDynamicTextPerformanceReportRequest Data Object](addynamictextperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|<a name="clicks"></a>Clicks|Clicks are what you pay for. Clicks typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network.

## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks
### <a name="requiredcolumns"></a>Required Columns
The report must include the following columns at a minimum. As a general rule, each report must include at least one attribute column and at least one non-impression share performance statistics column.
