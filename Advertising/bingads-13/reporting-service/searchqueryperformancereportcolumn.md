# SearchQueryPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [SearchQueryPerformanceReportRequest](searchqueryperformancereportrequest.md).

The report will include data only for search terms that resulted in a significant number of clicks in the last 30 days.

Since this data might change over time, please use the Keyword Performance Report to get the performance metrics for your keywords.

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

For example, if the search term delivered match type is either "Exact" or "Exact (close variant)", the keyword performance report would return the delivered match type as "Exact". Likewise, if the search term delivered match type is either "Phrase" or "Phrase (close variant)", the keyword performance report would return the delivered match type as "Phrase".<br/><br/>The performance metrics for the sum of "Exact" and "Exact (close variant)" should match the performance metrics in other reports for the same search term.
