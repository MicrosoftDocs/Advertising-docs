# Reporting API
The Reporting [service](../guides/web-service-addresses.md) defines an Application Programming Interface (API) that you can use to request and download reports.

|Interface|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[Guides](../guides/reporting-guides.md)|Lists guides for the Reporting API.|
|[Reporting Service Operations](reporting-service-operations.md)|Use the [SubmitGenerateReport](submitgeneratereport.md) and [PollGenerateReport](pollgeneratereport.md) operations to specify the type of report that you want to download, and get the download URL. For an overview, see [Request and Download a Report](../guides/request-download-report.md).|
|[Reporting Data Objects](reporting-data-objects.md)|You'll find most of the same reports that are available in the Microsoft Advertising web application, for example the [CampaignPerformanceReportRequest](campaignperformancereportrequest.md) and [SearchCampaignChangeHistoryReportRequest](searchcampaignchangehistoryreportrequest.md).|
|[Reporting Value Sets](reporting-value-sets.md)|Use the reporting value sets to specify the [attributes and performance statistics](../guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md) you want to download.|
