# CustomEventsRule Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a custom events remarketing rule. 

Remarketing rules are conditions used to determine who to add to your remarketing list. For the custom events rule, you must include one or more of the following conditional event operator pairs: (*ActionOperator* and *Action*), (*CategoryOperator* and *Category*), (*LabelOperator* and *Label*), (*ValueOperator* and *Value*). If more than one condition is specified, the conditions are joined using the logical *AND* operator. In other words the visitor will only be added to your remarketing list if all of the specified rule conditions are met.

For a detailed example, see the [Remarks](#remarks) section below.

## Syntax

The [CustomEventsRule](customeventsrule.md) object has [Inherited Elements](#inheritedelements).

## <a name="inheritedelements"></a>Inherited Elements

### <a name="inheritedelementsremarketingrule"></a>Inherited Elements from RemarketingRule
The [CustomEventsRule](customeventsrule.md) object derives from the [RemarketingRule](remarketingrule.md) object, and inherits the following elements: [Type](#type). The descriptions below are specific to [CustomEventsRule](customeventsrule.md), and might not apply to other objects that inherit the same elements from the [RemarketingRule](remarketingrule.md) object.  

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="type"></a>Type|The type of the remarketing rule. For more information about remarketing rule types, see the [RemarketingRule Data Object Remarks](remarketingrule.md#remarks).<br/><br/>**Add:** Read-only<br/>**Update:** Read-only|**string**|

## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks
For the *CustomEvents* rule, you must include one or more of the following conditional event operator pairs: (*ActionOperator* and *Action*), (*CategoryOperator* and *Category*), (*LabelOperator* and *Label*), (*ValueOperator* and *Value*). If more than one condition is specified, the conditions are joined using the logical *AND* operator. In other words the visitor will only be added to your remarketing list if all of the specified rule conditions are met.

For example let's say that the following custom events are set.

```xml
<Rule i:type="CustomEventsRule">
  <Type i:nil="true" />
  <Action>play</Action>
  <ActionOperator>Equals</ActionOperator>
  <Category>video</Category>
  <CategoryOperator>Equals</CategoryOperator>
  <Label>trailer</Label>
  <LabelOperator>Equals</LabelOperator>
  <Value>5.00</Value>
  <ValueOperator>Equals</ValueOperator>
</Rule>
```

The above definition is translated to the following logical expression:

*(Category Equals video) and (Action Equals play) and (Label Equals trailer) and (Value Equals 5)*

Evaluation of the logical expression determines who will be added to the remarketing list.
