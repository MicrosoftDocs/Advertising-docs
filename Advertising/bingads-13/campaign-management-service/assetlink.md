# AssetLink Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines the relationship of an asset to an ad.

For example, within a [ResponsiveSearchAd](responsivesearchad.md) there is an array of asset links that each contain a [TextAsset](textasset.md).

## <a name="elements"></a>Elements

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="asset"></a>Asset|The asset with a unique Microsoft Advertising identifier that can be reused across multiple ads.<br/><br/>For asset links included in a responsive search ad's [Headlines](responsivesearchad.md#headlines) and [Descriptions](responsivesearchad.md#descriptions) lists, the asset must be a [TextAsset](textasset.md).<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** Required|[Asset](asset.md)|
|<a name="assetperformancelabel"></a>AssetPerformanceLabel|Reserved for future use.|**string**|
|<a name="editorialstatus"></a>EditorialStatus|The editorial review status of the asset link, which indicates whether the asset is pending review, has been approved, or has been disapproved.<br/><br/>**Add:** Read-only<br/>**Update:** Read-only|[AssetLinkEditorialStatus](assetlinkeditorialstatus.md)|
|<a name="pinnedfield"></a>PinnedField|Determines whether the asset should only be used for a specific ad component, or whether you want Bing AI to optimize the layout for this asset.<br/><br/>Unless you have a specific requirement for an asset, don't pin it and let Bing AI optimize the placement.<br/><br/>If the [Asset](#asset) is a [TextAsset](textasset.md) and included in the responsive search ad's [Descriptions](responsivesearchad.md#descriptions) list, the valid pinned field values are *Description1* and *Description2*. At least one eligible [TextAsset](textasset.md) must be available for each description position, so you cannot pin all of the assets to the same position. For example you can have 3 text assets pinned to *Description1*, so long as you have at least one text asset in the responsive search ad's [Descriptions](responsivesearchad.md#descriptions) list that is either not pinned, or pinned to *Description2*.<br/><br/>If the [Asset](#asset) is a [TextAsset](textasset.md) and included in the responsive search ad's [Headlines](responsivesearchad.md#headlines) list, the valid pinned field values are *Headline1*, *Headline2*, and *Headline3*. At least one eligible [TextAsset](textasset.md) must be available for each headline position, so you cannot pin all of the assets to the same position. For example you can have 3 text assets pinned to *Headline1* and 3 text assets pinned to *Headline2*, so long as you have at least one text asset in the responsive search ad's [Headlines](responsivesearchad.md#headlines) list that is either not pinned, or pinned to *Headline3*.<br/><br/>If you previously pinned an asset to an ad component and later want to remove the pin, you'll need to update the ad with the existing assets and leave the pinned field element empty for the asset or assets that you want to unpin. When you retrieve an asset that is not pinned, the string value is nil or empty.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string**|
