# Webpage Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a webpage parameter that contains a list of webpage conditions or criteria that help determine whether you want to show dynamic search ads.

The *Webpage* criterion can be included within [BiddableAdGroupCriterion](biddableadgroupcriterion.md), [NegativeAdGroupCriterion](negativeadgroupcriterion.md), and [NegativeCampaignCriterion](negativecampaigncriterion.md) objects. If ad group level negative webpage criterions are specified, the campaign level negative webpage criterions are ignored for that ad group. In other words the ad group negative webpage criterions override the campaign negative webpage criterions, and are not applied as a union.   

A Webpage criterion can only be created within campaigns that have a [DynamicSearchAdsSetting](dynamicsearchadssetting.md).  
- Dynamic search ads campaigns where [CampaignType](campaign.md#campaigntype) is set to "DynamicSearchAds". 
- Search campaigns if the account is in the [mixed campaigns](../guides/mixed-campaigns.md) feature pilot, if the [CampaignType](campaign.md#campaigntype) is set to "Search", if the [ExperimentId](campaign.md#experimentid) element is not set, and if the [AdGroupType](adgroup.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchDynamic".
