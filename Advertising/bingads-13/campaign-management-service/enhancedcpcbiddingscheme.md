# EnhancedCpcBiddingScheme Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an object that represents the enhanced CPC bid strategy type.

With the *EnhancedCpc* (enhanced cost per click) bid strategy, you set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising will automatically adjust your bids in real time to increase your chances for a conversion. Your bid will go higher on searches that are more likely to convert and lower on searches less likely to convert (up or down, this change will be made after we apply any bid adjustments you have set). Over the long haul, though, we will try to make sure that your average CPC is not higher than your bid. If you haven't optimized your campaign yet, Enhanced CPC should reduce your cost per conversion and increase your total conversion count while respecting your current budget.  

Differing from the *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, *TargetCpa*, and *TargetRoas* bid strategies, with the *EnhancedCpc* bid strategy, Microsoft Advertising will not actually change your stored ad group or keyword bid settings. You can continue to set new bids, and we will use the new values as a starting point next opportunity.

> [!TIP] 
> You can set your campaign's bid strategy to EnhancedCpc, MaxClicks, MaxConversions, TargetCpa, or TargetRoas and then, at any time, set an individual ad group's or keyword's bid strategy to ManualCpc.  

> [!NOTE]
> For search ad and dynamic search ad campaigns, the *EnhancedCpc* bid strategy is available to all advertisers worldwide. 
> 
> For Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, the *EnhancedCpc* bid strategy is available wherever Microsoft Shopping Campaigns are available.
