# EnhancedCpcBiddingScheme Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an object that represents the enhanced CPC bid strategy type.

With the *EnhancedCpc* (enhanced cost per click) bid strategy, you set your ad group and keyword bids, and Microsoft Advertising will automatically adjust your bids in real time to increase your chances for a conversion. Your bid will go higher on searches that are more likely to convert and lower on searches less likely to convert (up or down, this change will be made after we apply any bid adjustments you have set). Over the long haul, though, we will try to make sure that your average CPC is not higher than your bid. If you haven't optimized your campaign yet, Enhanced CPC should reduce your cost per conversion and increase your total conversion count while respecting your current budget.  

Microsoft Advertising will not actually change your stored ad group or keyword bid settings. You can continue to set new bids, and we will use the new values as a starting point at the next opportunity.
