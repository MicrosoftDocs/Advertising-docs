# ResponsiveAd Data Object - Campaign Management
A responsive ad format for audience ads and multimedia ads.

The ResponsiveAd object is used for both [Multimedia ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60107/0) in the search network and [Audience ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56674/0) in the Microsoft Audience Network. See the [remarks](#remarks) section below for details about the key differentiators.

> [!NOTE]
> Duplicate responsive ads are allowed in the same ad group.

The [ResponsiveAd](responsivead.md) object has the following elements: [BusinessName](#businessname), [CallToAction](#calltoaction), [CallToActionLanguage](#calltoactionlanguage), [Descriptions](#descriptions), [Headline](#headline), [Headlines](#headlines), [Images](#images), [ImpressionTrackingUrls](#impressiontrackingurls), [LongHeadline](#longheadline), [LongHeadlines](#longheadlines), [LongHeadlineString](#longheadlinestring), [Text](#text), [Videos](#videos).

## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks
The ResponsiveAd object is used for [Multimedia ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60107/0) in the search network and [Audience ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/56674/0) in the Microsoft Audience Network. 

Most supported properties are the same, but here are some of the key differentiators.

- For audience ads you'll set [BusinessName](#businessname), [Headline](#headline), [Images](#images), [ImpressionTrackingUrls](#impressiontrackingurls), [LongHeadlineString](#longheadlinestring), and [Text](#text).
- For multimedia ads you'll set [BusinessName](#businessname), [CallToAction](#calltoaction), [CallToActionLanguage](#calltoactionlanguage), [Descriptions](#descriptions), [Headlines](#headlines), [Images](#images), and [LongHeadlines](#longheadlines).

> [!NOTE]
> The data for [Images](#images) are provisioned via the [AddMedia](addmedia.md) operation. You can use the GIF, JPEG, or PNG MIME types. Images with animation are not supported. Although you can only add media with a few aspect ratios via the [AddMedia](addmedia.md) operation, you can use [ImageAsset](imageasset.md) crop settings to determine the effective aspect ratio in the context of each responsive ad [AssetLink](assetlink.md). The aspect ratio of the stored image would be unchanged in the account level media library.
>
> The maximum file size is 5 MB. The maximum width and height in pixels are 2592 and 2048 independently, and you must still maintain one of the supported aspect ratios. For example if the image asset with sub type LandscapeImageMedia is 2592 in width, then the height must be 1357.

### Multimedia ad images

For multimedia ads you'll create multiple image assets with different sizes and aspect ratios. You need to add at least 1 image with 1.91:1 aspect ratio and 1 image with 1:1 aspect ratio.

In the [Images](#images) element include one or more [AssetLink](assetlink.md) objects. Each asset link contains an [ImageAsset](imageasset.md) with [SubType](imageasset.md#subtype) set to one of the string values in the table below.

|Sub Type|Minimum dimensions in pixels|
|--------|--------|--------|
|Image191x100|703 width x 368 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.91:1|
|Image4x1|608 width x 152 height<br/>Aspect radio 4:1|
|Image1x1|470 width x 470 height<br/>Aspect radio 1:1|
|Image1x2|470 width x 940 height<br/>Aspect radio 1:2|

### Audience ad images

For audience ads you'll create multiple image assets with different sizes, aspect ratios, and crop settings so they can flexibly display across a variety of publishers and placements. 

In the [Images](#images) element include one or more [AssetLink](assetlink.md) objects. Each asset link contains an [ImageAsset](imageasset.md) with [SubType](imageasset.md#subtype) set to one of the string values in the table below.

|Sub Type|Minimum dimensions in pixels|
|--------|--------|--------|
|LandscapeImageMedia|703 width x 368 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.91:1|
|SquareImageMedia|300 width x 300 height<br/>Aspect radio 1:1|
|ImageMedia169X100|622 width x 368 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.69:1|
|ImageMedia93X100|311 width x 333 height<br/>Aspect radio 0.93:1|
|ImageMedia15X10|300 width x 200 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.5:1|
|ImageMedia155X100|300 width x 194 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.55:1|
|ImageMedia133X100|100 width x 75 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.33:1|
|ImageMedia178X100|624 width x 350 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.78:1|
|ImageMedia172X100|300 width x 174 height<br/>Aspect radio 1.72:1|

You are only required to provide a landscape image asset. In the [Images](#images) element include an [AssetLink](assetlink.md) that contains one [ImageAsset](imageasset.md) with [SubType](imageasset.md#subtype) set to LandscapeImageMedia. The recommended dimensions for the LandscapeImageMedia are 1200 width x 628 height. Optionally you can include additional asset links, i.e., one image asset for each supported sub type. For any image asset sub types that you do not explicitly set, Microsoft Advertising will automatically create image asset links by cropping the LandscapeImageMedia. 

Given the [GetAdsByAdGroupId](getadsbyadgroupid.md) response example below, please take note of the following:

- The same image asset identifier (e.g., 1234567890000) is used for all auto-generated image asset sub types. Whether or not you let Microsoft Advertising automatically generate the cropped images, the [Id](imageasset.md#id) does not need to be unique among the image assets linked to the same ad.
- Because the ad in this example was created without crop settings for the LandscapeImageMedia image asset sub type, all image assets are cropped except for the original landscape image.
- Whether or not the landscape image has its own crop settings, Microsoft Advertising uses the true height of the landscape image for all of the default crop settings. In this example the crop height for all system-generated image assets is 628, and we can infer that the landscape image (LandscapeImageMedia sub type) with 1.91:1 aspect ratio has width and height of 1200x628. Even if the landscape image asset link had been created with crop settings e.g., 703x368, the crop settings of the auto-generated image assets are based on the full dimensions of the landscape image (again that would be 1200x628 in this example).
