# InStoreTransactionGoal Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an in-store transaction goal. 

In-store transactions empower retail advertisers with a holistic view of return on ad spend. You can observe how specific Microsoft Advertising accounts and campaigns drive offline purchases. 

> [!NOTE]
> In-store transaction goals are only available for alpha pilot customers. Only one in-store transaction goal can be created per customer.

### <a name="inheritedelementsconversiongoal"></a>Inherited Elements from ConversionGoal
The [InStoreTransactionGoal](instoretransactiongoal.md) object derives from the [ConversionGoal](conversiongoal.md) object, and inherits the following elements: [ConversionWindowInMinutes](#conversionwindowinminutes), [CountType](#counttype), [ExcludeFromBidding](#excludefrombidding), [GoalCategory](#goalcategory), [Id](#id), [Name](#name), [Revenue](#revenue), [Scope](#scope), [Status](#status), [TagId](#tagid), [TrackingStatus](#trackingstatus), [Type](#type), [ViewThroughConversionWindowInMinutes](#viewthroughconversionwindowinminutes). The descriptions below are specific to [InStoreTransactionGoal](instoretransactiongoal.md), and might not apply to other objects that inherit the same elements from the [ConversionGoal](conversiongoal.md) object.  

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="conversionwindowinminutes"></a>ConversionWindowInMinutes|The conversion window is the length of time in minutes after a click that you want to track conversions. If you set this value to 43200 minutes (30 days), then conversions that happen within 30 days after a click are tracked. Past conversions aren't affected. The minimum value supported is 1 minute, although keep in mind that a shorter conversion window will reduce the number of conversions your account records. The maximum value supported is 129600 minutes (90 days).<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**int**|
|<a name="counttype"></a>CountType|This determines how your conversions are recorded within your chosen conversion window.<br/><br/>There are two choices, and if you do not set a value the default is *All*:<br/><br/>- *All*:  All conversions that happen after an ad click will be counted. This is a common choice for sales. <br/><br/>-  *Unique*:  Only one conversion that happens after an ad click will be counted. This is a common choice for leads.<br/><br/>For example:  You track two conversions: leads and sales. You pick *Unique* for leads and *All* for sales. When one ad click turns into two leads and two sales, it's counted as three conversions: one for the unique lead, and two for all the sales.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[ConversionGoalCountType](conversiongoalcounttype.md)|
|<a name="excludefrombidding"></a>ExcludeFromBidding|Determines whether or not to exclude data otherwise related to this conversion goal from a subset of performance report columns.<br/><br/>This element is only available for customers who are enabled for the Include in Conversions feature ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 574).<br/><br/>If this element is set to true, data otherwise related to this conversion goal will be excluded from the `Conversions`, `ConversionRate`, `CostPerConversion`, `ReturnOnAdSpend`, `RevenuePerConversion`, and `Revenue` report columns. Also, if you use an automated bidding bid strategy, setting this property true will result in the goal's conversions no longer factoring into automated bidding calculations. Setting this property "true" is effectively the same as unchecking "Include in Conversions" in the Microsoft Advertising web application.<br/><br/>Regardless of this element value, the `AllConversions`, `AllConversionRate`, `AllCostPerConversion`, `AllReturnOnAdSpend`, `AllRevenuePerConversion`, and `AllRevenue` report columns will include data for all conversion goals. By default this element is false, and data related to this conversion goal are included in all report columns.<br/><br/>For more information, see [Report Attributes and Performance Statistics](../guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md) and the help article [Conversion goals: "Conversions" versus "All conversions"](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56920/-1/en/#ext:reporting).<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**boolean**|
|<a name="goalcategory"></a>GoalCategory|The category used to segment the conversion goal.<br/><br/>Categorize your conversion goals however makes sense for your business. Goal categories don't affect performance - they are here to help you segment your goals and their performance metrics.<br/><br/>The supported category values vary by conversion goal type. In-store transaction goals only support the [Purchase](conversiongoalcategory.md#purchase) category.<br/><br/>**Add:** Required beginning in March 2021. In the meantime if you leave this element nil or empty, the default category will be set to [Purchase](conversiongoalcategory.md#purchase).<br/>**Update:** Required beginning in March 2021. In the meantime if the conversion goal does not yet have a category set and if you leave this element nil or empty, the default category will be set to [Purchase](conversiongoalcategory.md#purchase). This element is optional during update if the conversion goal already has a category set.|[ConversionGoalCategory](conversiongoalcategory.md)|
|<a name="id"></a>Id|The unique Microsoft Advertising identifier for the conversion goal.<br/><br/>**Add:** Read-only<br/>**Update:** Required and Read-Only|**long**|
|<a name="name"></a>Name|The conversion goal name.<br/><br/>The maximum length of the name is 100, and the name must be unique among all conversion goals belonging to the same customer.<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string**|
|<a name="revenue"></a>Revenue|Determines how much each conversion is worth to your business.<br/><br/>When adding a conversion goal if you do not specify any revenue tracking preferences, then each [ConversionGoalRevenue](conversiongoalrevenue.md) will be set to their respective default values.<br/><br/>When updating a conversion goal, if the *Revenue* element is nil or empty then none of the nested properties will be updated. However, if this element is not nil or empty then you are effectively replacing any existing revenue properties.<br/><br/>You must specify the [ConversionGoalRevenue CurrencyCode](conversiongoalrevenue.md#currencycode) when adding or updating an in-store transaction goal.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[ConversionGoalRevenue](conversiongoalrevenue.md)|
|<a name="scope"></a>Scope|Determines if the goal applies to all accounts or only the account specified in the required *CustomerAccountId* header element.<br/><br/>For in-store transaction goals the *Account* level scope is not supported. You can set this element to *Customer* or leave it nil. If not specified, the scope will be set to *Customer* by default.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[EntityScope](entityscope.md)|
|<a name="status"></a>Status|Defines the possible user-determined status values of a conversion goal. These are the status values that a user can decide to set, for example a goal can be set to *Paused* if you no longer wish to track conversions for that goal.<br/><br/>For status values that can be set by the system, see the *TrackingStatus* element.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[ConversionGoalStatus](conversiongoalstatus.md)|
|<a name="tagid"></a>TagId|Not applicable for in-store transaction goals.|**long**|
