# BidStrategy Data Object - Campaign Management
A portfolio bid strategy is an automated bidding feature that manages bidding across multiple campaigns that are all working toward the same goal.  

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worryâ€”it's coming soon!

> [!NOTE]
> You can set individual campaign level bid strategies using the [AddCampaigns](addcampaigns.md) and [UpdateCampaigns](updatecampaigns.md) operations.  

We automatically adjust your bids to balance under- and over-performing campaigns that share the same strategy, whether to maximize conversions, clicks, target impression share, or other performance goals. Portfolio bid strategies could be a great option for advertisers who want to make sure their entire budgets are spent efficiently.

All you have to do is choose a bid strategy type and associate campaigns with complementary budget limits. Microsoft Advertising will adjust your bids based on the performance of the entire portfolio. If your portfolio includes campaigns with a shared budget, then you should only include other campaigns that share the same budget.  

Portfolio bid strategies work best with one goal in mind, using complementary campaign and bid strategy types. You cannot change a portfolio's bid strategy type. If you want a campaign in the portfolio to use a different bid strategy you can move it to another portfolio. Once you choose a campaign type, the portfolio can only include campaigns of that type.  

|Bid strategy type|Campaign types supported|

|Maximize clicks|Search, Shopping|
|Maximize conversions|Search|
|Target CPA|Search|
|Target impression share|Search
|Target ROAS|Search, Shopping|
