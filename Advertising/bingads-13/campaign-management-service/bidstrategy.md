# BidStrategy Data Object - Campaign Management
A portfolio bid strategy is an automated bidding feature that manages bidding across multiple campaigns that are all working toward the same goal.  

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry - it's coming soon!

> [!NOTE]
> You can set individual campaign level bid strategies using the [AddCampaigns](addcampaigns.md) and [UpdateCampaigns](updatecampaigns.md) operations.  

We automatically adjust your bids to balance under- and over-performing campaigns that share the same strategy, whether to maximize conversions, clicks, target impression share, or other performance goals. Portfolio bid strategies could be a great option for advertisers who want to make sure their entire budgets are spent efficiently.

All you have to do is choose a bid strategy type and include campaigns with complementary budgets in the portfolio. Microsoft Advertising will adjust your bids based on the performance of the entire portfolio. If your portfolio includes any campaigns with a shared budget, then you should include all of the campaigns that share the same budget.  

You can have up to 11,000 portfolio bid strategies in an account, and each portfolio can include 10,000 campaigns.  

Portfolio bid strategies work best with one goal in mind, using complementary campaign and bid strategy types. You cannot change a portfolio's bid strategy type. If you want a campaign in the portfolio to use a different bid strategy you can move it to another portfolio. Once you choose a campaign type, the portfolio can only include campaigns of that type.  

|Bid strategy type|Campaign types supported|

|Maximize conversions|Search|
|Target CPA|Search|

|Target ROAS|Search, Shopping|
