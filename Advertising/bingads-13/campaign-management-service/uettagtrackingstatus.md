# UetTagTrackingStatus Value Set - Campaign Management
Defines the possible system-determined status values of a UET tag. These are the status values that can be set by the system, for example the system sets the status to *Unverified* if the UET tag has not yet been verified. 

> [!NOTE]
> The *UetTagTrackingStatus* in part influences the system-determined [ConversionGoalTrackingStatus](conversiongoaltrackingstatus.md) of any [ConversionGoal](conversiongoal.md) that is associated with the [UetTag](uettag.md). If the *UetTagTrackingStatus* is *Active* then the [ConversionGoalTrackingStatus](conversiongoaltrackingstatus.md) can be either *NoRecentConversions* or *RecordingConversions*, and otherwise the conversion goal tracking status mirrors the tag status.
