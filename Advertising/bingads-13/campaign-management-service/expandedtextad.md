# ExpandedTextAd Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an expanded text ad.

This ad format works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices so you can focus more on crafting your longer ad copy and optimizing your ad text to better engage your customers before they click your ad.

The combination of the FinalUrls, Path1, Path2, Text, TextPart2, TitlePart1, TitlePart2 and TitlePart3 elements make the expanded text ad unique.

## <a name="elements"></a>Elements

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="domain"></a>Domain|The URL that will be displayed instead of the final URL. The final URL will still be used for the landing page URL.<br/><br/>Reserved for limited pilot usage e.g. pharmaceutical customers.<br/><br/>The domain portion of the URL in combination with the path 1 and path 2 strings cannot exceed 67 characters.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string**|
|<a name="path1"></a>Path1|The first part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *http://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL ([FinalUrls](#finalurls) element). Then if you have specified a value for [Path1](#path1) it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for [Path2](#path2), then it will also be appended to the display URL after [Path1](#path1). For example if your [FinalUrls](#finalurls) contains *http://www.contoso.com*, [Path1](#path1) is set to *subdirectory1*, and [Path2](#path2) is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *http://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.<br/><br/>The path can contain a countdown function. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md).<br/><br/>The path can contain dynamic parameters such as {MatchType}. For a list of supported parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).<br/><br/>The maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 15 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of the final URL domain and the paths combined exceed 67 characters.<br/><br/>For languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 7 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of the final URL domain and the paths combined exceed 33 characters. The double-width characters are determined by the characters you use instead of the character set of the campaign or ad group language settings. Double-width characters include Korean, Japanese and Chinese languages characters as well as Emojis.<br/><br/>The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters.<br/><br/>If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string**|
|<a name="path2"></a>Path2|The second part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *http://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL ([FinalUrls](#finalurls) element).  Then if you have specified a value for [Path1](#path1) it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for [Path2](#path2), then it will also be appended to the display URL after [Path1](#path1). For example if your [FinalUrls](#finalurls) contains *http://www.contoso.com*, [Path1](#path1) is set to *subdirectory1*, and [Path2](#path2) is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *http://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.<br/><br/>You can only specify [Path2](#path2) if [Path1](#path1) is also set.<br/><br/>The path can contain a countdown function. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md).<br/><br/>The path can contain dynamic parameters such as {MatchType}.

|<a name="text"></a>Text|The first part of the ad description.<br/><br/>The text must contain at least one word. For efficient use of resources we recommend that you use dynamic text strings such as {keyword} instead of creating new ad copy for each keyword. For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1).<br/><br/>The text can contain a countdown function.

|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="adformatpreference"></a>AdFormatPreference|The Ad Format Preference is used to indicate whether or not you prefer the ad copy to be shown to users as a search or audience ad. Search ads tend to be written as a call to action, whereas audience ads should be written in more of an informational style. While you have the option to use expanded text ads as audience ads, designating an ad as Audience ads preferred format allows you to optimize its messaging for native delivery.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** You must define at least one expanded text ad per ad group that does not prefer audience ads, otherwise the ad copy of all expanded text ads will be eligible for both search and audience ads.<br/><br/>Possible values are *AudienceAd* and *All*. If set to *All*, the ad will be eligible for both search and audience ad formats. If set to *AudienceAd*, the ad will only be eligible for the audience ad format.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional.

If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}* and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string**|

For customers in the Custom Parameters Limit Increase Phase 2 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 565), Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. During calendar year 2019 the limit will be increased from 3 to 8 for all customers.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. Set the *UrlCustomParameters* element to null or empty to retain any existing custom parameters. To remove all custom parameters, set the [Parameters](customparameters.md#parameters) element of the [CustomParameters](customparameters.md) object to null or empty. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep in the [Parameters](customparameters.md#parameters) element of the [CustomParameters](customparameters.md) object.|[CustomParameters](customparameters.md)|
