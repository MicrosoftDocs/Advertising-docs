# ExpandedTextAd Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an expanded text ad.

This ad format works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices so you can focus more on crafting your longer ad copy and optimizing your ad text to better engage your customers before they click your ad. 

> [!NOTE]
> Expanded text ads can only be created in Search campaigns where the [AdGroupType](adgroup.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchStandard". If the [AdGroupType](adgroup.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchDynamic", then the ad group does not support expanded text ads.  

The combination of the FinalUrls, Path1, Path2, Text, TextPart2, TitlePart1, TitlePart2 and TitlePart3 elements make the expanded text ad unique.

## <a name="elements"></a>Elements

The [ExpandedTextAd](expandedtextad.md) object has the following elements: [Domain](#domain), [Path1](#path1), [Path2](#path2), [Text](#text), [TextPart2](#textpart2), [TitlePart1](#titlepart1), [TitlePart2](#titlepart2), [TitlePart3](#titlepart3).

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="domain"></a>Domain|The URL that will be displayed instead of the final URL. The final URL will still be used for the landing page URL.<br/><br/>Reserved for limited pilot usage e.g. pharmaceutical customers.<br/><br/>The domain portion of the URL in combination with the path 1 and path 2 strings cannot exceed 67 characters.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this element to an empty string (*""*), the previous setting will be deleted.|**string**|
|<a name="path1"></a>Path1|The first part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *https://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL ([FinalUrls](#finalurls) element). Then if you have specified a value for [Path1](#path1) it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for [Path2](#path2), then it will also be appended to the display URL after [Path1](#path1). For example if your [FinalUrls](#finalurls) contains *https://www.contoso.com*, [Path1](#path1) is set to *subdirectory1*, and [Path2](#path2) is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *https://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.<br/><br/>The path can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md).<br/><br/>The path can contain dynamic parameters such as {MatchType}. For a list of supported parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).<br/><br/>The maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 15 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of the final URL domain and the paths combined exceed 67 characters.<br/><br/>For languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 7 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of the final URL domain and the paths combined exceed 33 characters. The double-width characters are determined by the characters you use instead of the character set of the campaign or ad group language settings. Double-width characters include Korean, Japanese and Chinese languages characters as well as Emojis.<br/><br/>The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters.<br/><br/>If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this element to an empty string (*""*), the previous setting will be deleted.|**string**|
|<a name="path2"></a>Path2|The second part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *https://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL ([FinalUrls](#finalurls) element).  Then if you have specified a value for [Path1](#path1) it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for [Path2](#path2), then it will also be appended to the display URL after [Path1](#path1). For example if your [FinalUrls](#finalurls) contains *https://www.contoso.com*, [Path1](#path1) is set to *subdirectory1*, and [Path2](#path2) is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *https://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.<br/><br/>You can only specify [Path2](#path2) if [Path1](#path1) is also set.<br/><br/>The path can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions.

The [ExpandedTextAd](expandedtextad.md) object has [Inherited Elements](#inheritedelements).

## <a name="inheritedelements"></a>Inherited Elements

### <a name="inheritedelementsad"></a>Inherited Elements from Ad
The [ExpandedTextAd](expandedtextad.md) object derives from the [Ad](ad.md) object, and inherits the following elements: [AdFormatPreference](#adformatpreference), [DevicePreference](#devicepreference), [EditorialStatus](#editorialstatus), [FinalAppUrls](#finalappurls), [FinalMobileUrls](#finalmobileurls), [FinalUrls](#finalurls), [FinalUrlSuffix](#finalurlsuffix), [ForwardCompatibilityMap](#forwardcompatibilitymap), [Id](#id), [Status](#status), [TrackingUrlTemplate](#trackingurltemplate), [Type](#type), [UrlCustomParameters](#urlcustomparameters). The descriptions below are specific to [ExpandedTextAd](expandedtextad.md), and might not apply to other objects that inherit the same elements from the [Ad](ad.md) object.  

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="adformatpreference"></a>AdFormatPreference|The Ad Format Preference is used to indicate whether or not you prefer the ad copy to be shown to users as a search or audience ad. Search ads tend to be written as a call to action, whereas audience ads should be written in more of an informational style. While you have the option to use expanded text ads as audience ads, designating an ad as Audience ads preferred format allows you to optimize its messaging for native delivery.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** You must define at least one expanded text ad per ad group that does not prefer audience ads, otherwise the ad copy of all expanded text ads will be eligible for both search and audience ads.<br/><br/>Possible values are *AudienceAd* and *All*. If set to *All*, the ad will be eligible for both search and audience ad formats. If set to *AudienceAd*, the ad will only be eligible for the audience ad format.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this element, by default the ad format preference will be set to *All*.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.|**string**|

Also note that  if this ad's [TrackingUrlTemplate](#trackingurltemplate) or [UrlCustomParameters](#urlcustomparameters) element are set, then at least one final URL is required.<br/><br/>This URL is used only if the keyword does not specify a final URL.<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string** array|
|<a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>FinalUrlSuffix|The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional.

For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)<br/>- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).<br/>- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.<br/>- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*.<br/>- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}* and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional.
