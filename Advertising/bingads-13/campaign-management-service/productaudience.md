# ProductAudience Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a product audience that you can use to remarket products from your Microsoft Merchant Center store. 

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamic remarketing lists were formerly known as product audiences in Microsoft Advertising. You'll see "Dynamic remarketing list" in the Microsoft Advertising UI, but to avoid breaking changes the API objets are still named "product audience". 

Dynamic remarketing lists pair customers with specific products based on what they have looked at, considered, or already purchased on your website. You can use dynamic remarketing lists in both search campaigns and audience campaigns (not everyone has audience campaigns yet). 

Dynamic remarketing lists work best with both Shopping campaigns and feed-based Audience campaigns i.e., those campaigns that leverage a Microsoft Merchant Center [store ID](shoppingsetting.md#storeid). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to edit the script corresponding to the [UET Tag Id](#tagid) on your website to include the `ecomm_prodid` and `ecomm_pagetype` parameters.
> The ecomm_prodid parameter is the product ID of the product on the page. It is unique for each item and must match either the id or item_group_id attribute in your product feed. Numeric and alphanumeric (including hyphens) characters only, with a maximum of 50 characters. 
> The ecomm_pagetype parameter identifies the type of page the user has visited. Valid options: home, searchresults, category, product, cart, purchase, other.

```javascript
window.uetq = window.uetq || [];
window.uetq.push('event', '', {'ecomm_prodid': 'REPLACE_WITH_PRODUCT_ID', 'ecomm_pagetype': 'REPLACE_WITH_PAGE_TYPE'});
```

## Syntax
```xml
<xs:complexType name="ProductAudience" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
