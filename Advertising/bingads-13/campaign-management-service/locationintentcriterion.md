# LocationIntentCriterion Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a criterion that determines the intent option for all location and radius criterions of the campaign or ad group. There isn't any accompanying criterion bid adjustment. 

The maximum number of location intent criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is one.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only have one [LocationIntentCriterion](locationintentcriterion.md) per campaign or ad group to determine the location intent option that applies for all of the campaign or ad group's geographical criterions (location, negative location, and location intent criterions). When you create the campaign or ad group's first criterion, a [LocationIntentCriterion](locationintentcriterion.md) will also be added automatically with the default *IntentOption* set to *PeopleInOrSearchingForOrViewingPages*. You can add or update a campaign or ad group's [LocationIntentCriterion](locationintentcriterion.md), whether or not the campaign or ad group has any other criterions. You cannot delete a [LocationIntentCriterion](locationintentcriterion.md), although it has no purpose without location or location intent criterions. 

The *LocationIntentCriterion* criterion can be included within [BiddableAdGroupCriterion](biddableadgroupcriterion.md) and[BiddableCampaignCriterion](biddablecampaigncriterion.md) objects. 

Also note that you must consider the location, negative location, and radius criterions as a set of *geo criterions*. If the ad group has any geo criterions, then none of the campaign's geo criterions are inherited. If the ad group doesn't have any geo criterions, then all of the campaign's geo criterions are inherited. The geo criterions can be inherited from the campaign even if the ad group has a location intent criterion. If the ad group's geo criterions are used, then the ad group's location intent criterion is used; if the campaign's geo criterions are inherited, then the campaign's location intent criterion is used and the ad group's location intent criterion is ignored. You cannot delete a campaign or ad group's location intent criterion, although it has no purpose without location or radius criterions.
