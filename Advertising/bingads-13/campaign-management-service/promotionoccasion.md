# PromotionOccasion Value Set - Campaign Management
Defines the possible types of promotion occasions.

Both the [PromotionOccasion](promotionadextension.md#promotionoccasion) and [Scheduling](promotionadextension.md#scheduling) elements determine when the promotion is eligible to be shown in ads.

The [PromotionOccasion](promotionadextension.md#promotionoccasion) determines the time period or seasonality e.g., [WomensDay](#womensday) from February 15 through March 31 each year. The promotion will only run within the dates corresponding to the occasion that you set. See [PromotionOccasion](promotionoccasion.md) for details about the defined date range for each occasion.

The [Scheduling](promotionadextension.md#scheduling) can limit the promotion to a shorter timeframe within the occasion's date range e.g., limit the promotion to run from February 20 through March 8. The [Scheduling](promotionadextension.md#scheduling) can also be used to run the same promotion multiple years e.g., run the [WomensDay](#womensday) promotion every year from February 15 through March 31.
