# Customer List Record - Bulk
Defines a customer list that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can upload customer list data via Bulk API, you must first create one customer list audience and accept the terms and conditions in the Microsoft Advertising UI. The initial customer list doesn't need to contain any customer data, but you must select I ACCEPT. By selecting "I accept" you (1) agree that you are able to lawfully disclose audience details, which is personal data, to Microsoft and (2) accept the Customer Match Terms, the Microsoft Advertising Agreement, and the Microsoft Advertising policies. Microsoft will use the data that you upload in accordance with the [Customer Match Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2106709).

A customer list is a set of customer contact information that you have compiled to enable customer match. Each list can include multiple Email items. 
- Include the [Customer List](customer-list.md) record in the Bulk upload file and set its [Action Type](customer-list.md#actiontype) field to "Add", "Remove", or "Replace". 
- Include one or more [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records in the same Bulk upload file and set the [Parent Id](customer-list-item.md#parentid), [Sub Type](customer-list-item.md#subtype), and [Text](customer-list-item.md#text) fields. 

You can add or update a [Customer List](customer-list.md) record without any [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records in the same Bulk upload file; however, you cannot upload any [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records without the accompanying parent [Customer List](customer-list.md) record. 

After 48 hours, check the Audience Size fields e.g., [Audience Search Size](#audiencesearchsize) to see how many of these customers we matched on the Bing Network. At that point, your ads can start showing for this new audience.

> [!TIP]
> For an overview and more information about audiences, see the [Audience APIs](../guides/universal-event-tracking.md#audience) technical guide. 

You can download all *Customer List* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CustomerLists* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new customer list. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Client Id,Modified Time,Name,Description,Scope,Audience,Action Type
Format Version,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,
Customer List,Active,-10,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,New customer list description,Customer,New Customer List,Add
```

## <a name="actiontype"></a>Action Type
Determines whether to add, remove, or replace the [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records that you include in the same Bulk upload file. 

If the action type is "Add", the service will attempt to add the [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records that you include in the same Bulk upload file. 

If the action type is set to "Remove", the service will attempt to remove the [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records that you include in the same Bulk upload file. 

If the action type is set to "Replace", all previous customer match data for this list will be removed, and the service will attempt to add the [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records that you include in the same Bulk upload file. 

**Add:** Optional. By default the "Add" action type is used for new customer lists. Whether or not you set a value, this field is ignored for new customer lists.   
**Update:** Required if you are also including [Customer List Item](customer-list-item.md) records for an existing audience in the same Bulk upload file, and otherwise this field is optional.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="audience"></a>Audience
The name of the customer list.

The name can contain a maximum of 128 characters.  

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="audiencenetworksize"></a>Audience Network Size
The total number of people who are active members of this audience in the Audience network. This gives you an idea of how many Audience network users you can target.

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="audiencesearchsize"></a>Audience Search Size
The total number of people who are active members of this audience in the Search network. This gives you an idea of how many search users you can target.

The audience needs to have at least 300 people before Microsoft Advertising will use it for optimizations.

This property will be empty for up to 24 hours while the audience is being built, for example if you add or update the customer list membership duration, rule, or tag identifier. 

This property will be empty if the UET tag associated with the customer list has a status of Unverified or Inactive, because the customer list can't receive the customer information from your website that it needs to build the list.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="description"></a>Description

The description can contain a maximum of 1,024 characters.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.   
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the customer list.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the customer list can then be referenced in the *Parent Id* field of dependent record types such as [customer list item](customer-list-item.md#parentid). This is required if you are adding a new customer list and new customer list items in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

## <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
