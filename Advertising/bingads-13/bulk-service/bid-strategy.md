# Bid Strategy Record - Bulk
Defines a bid strategy that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

A portfolio bid strategy is an automated bidding feature that manages bidding across multiple campaigns that are all working toward the same goal.

We automatically adjust your bids to balance under- and over-performing campaigns that share the same strategy, whether to maximize conversions, clicks, target impression share, or other performance goals. Portfolio bid strategies could be a great option for advertisers who want to make sure their entire budgets are spent efficiently.

All you have to do is choose a bid strategy type and include campaigns with complementary budgets in the portfolio. Microsoft Advertising will adjust your bids based on the performance of the entire portfolio. If your portfolio includes any campaigns with a shared budget, then you should include all of the campaigns that share the same budget.  

You can have up to 11,000 portfolio bid strategies in an account, and each portfolio can include 10,000 campaigns. 

Portfolio bid strategies work best with one goal in mind, using complementary campaign and bid strategy types. You cannot change a portfolio's bid strategy type. If you want a campaign in the portfolio to use a different bid strategy you can move it to another portfolio. Once you choose a campaign type, the portfolio can only include campaigns of that type.  

|Bid strategy type|Campaign types supported|
|-----|-----|
|Maximize clicks|Search, Shopping|
|Maximize conversions|Search|
|Target CPA|Search|
|Target impression share|Search|
|Target ROAS|Search, Shopping|

You can download all *Bid Strategy* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *BidStrategies* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new bid strategy. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Sync Time,Client Id,Modified Time,Language,Time Zone,Budget Id,Budget Name,Budget,Budget Type,Name,Campaign Type,Bid Strategy Id,Bid Strategy Name,Bid Strategy Type,Bid Strategy MaxCpc,Bid Strategy TargetCpa,Bid Strategy TargetRoas,Bid Strategy TargetAdPosition,Bid Strategy TargetImpressionShare
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,
Bid Strategy,,-24,0,,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,,,,,,,Search,,My MaxCpc Bid Strategy,MaxClicks,1.5,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkBidStrategy* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkBidStrategy
var bulkBidStrategy = new BulkBidStrategy
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // BidStrategy object of the Campaign Management service.
    BidStrategy = new BidStrategy
    {
        // 'Campaign Type' column header in the Bulk file
        AssociatedCampaignType = CampaignType.Search,

        // 'Bid Strategy Type' column header in the Bulk file
        BiddingScheme = new MaxClicksBiddingScheme
        {
            // 'Bid Strategy MaxCpc' column header in the Bulk file
            MaxCpc = new Bid
            {
                Amount = 1.50
            }
        },
        // 'Budget Name' column header in the Bulk file
        Name = "My MaxCpc Bid Strategy " + DateTime.UtcNow,
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = bidStrategyIdKey,
    },

    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkBidStrategy);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
