# Ad Group Record - Bulk
Defines an ad group that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

You can download all *Ad Group* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroups* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. To include the [Keyword Relevance](#keywordrelevance), [Landing Page Relevance](#landingpagerelevance), [Landing Page User Experience](#landingpageuserexperience), and [Quality Score](#qualityscore) fields within the downloaded *Campaign* records, you must also include the [QualityScoreData](datascope.md#qualityscoredata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group if the correct campaign Id would be provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Network Distribution,Ad Rotation,Cpc Bid,Language,Bid Adjustment,Name,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Custom Parameter,Bid Strategy Type,Target Setting
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,

```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkAdGroup* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAdGroup
var bulkAdGroup = new BulkAdGroup

## <a name="adgroup"></a>Ad Group
The name of the ad group.

The name must be unique among all active ad groups within the campaign. The name can contain a maximum of 256 characters.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="adgrouptype"></a>Ad Group Type
The ad group type.

In a [mixed campaign](../guides/mixed-campaigns.md) where the [Campaign Type](campaign.md#campaigntype) is "Search", the [Experiment Id](campaign.md#experimentid) is not set, and the campaign already has valid dynamic search ads settings (comprised of the [Domain Language](campaign.md#domainlanguage), [Page Feed Ids](campaign.md#pagefeedids), [Source](campaign.md#source), and [Website](campaign.md#website) fields), the possible values are "SearchDynamic" and "SearchStandard". Otherwise the type of ad groups within "Search" campaigns can only be set to "SearchStandard". If the ad group type is "SearchDynamic", then you can only add dynamic search ads within this ad group. If the ad group type is "SearchStandard", then you can add expanded text ads or responsive search ads within this ad group.  

The type of ad groups within "DynamicSearchAds" campaigns can only be set to "SearchDynamic". You don't need to set the ad group type for "DynamicSearchAds" campaigns, but please note when you retrieve ad groups this field will be set to "SearchDynamic".

This field cannot be set for "Audience" or "Shopping" campaign types. When you retrieve an ad group within unsupported campaigns, this field will be empty.

**Add:** Optional. The default value for Search campaigns is "SearchStandard". The default value for "DynamicSearchAds" campaigns is "SearchDynamic".  
**Update:** Read-only. You cannot update the ad group type.     
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="adrotation"></a>Ad Rotation
Ad rotation sets how often Microsoft Advertising selects which ads to serve, if you have multiple ads within an ad group. Since no more than one ad from your account can show at a time, ad rotation prioritizes ads that appear statistically more likely to perform better.

> [!NOTE]
> Ad rotation does not apply to Product Ads.

Possible values are *OptimizeForClicks* and *RotateAdsEvenly*.

If set to *OptimizeForClicks*, Microsoft Advertising prioritizes the ad from the ad group that appears to have the best chance of performing well, based on auction characteristics or factors, such as keyword, search term, device or location. Better-performing ads will show more frequently, and others will be served less often, if at all.

If set to *RotateAdsEvenly*, Microsoft Advertising provides more balance in rotation between your ads. That is, the ads in a particular ad group have a similar chance of being displayed in response to a searcher's query. Ads are prioritized lower if they have lower ad quality, and therefore might display less often, or not at all.
- The *RotateAdsEvenly* setting can allow lower-performing ads to display as often as better-performing ads. This might impact ad group performance.
- The *RotateAdsEvenly* setting will be ignored if the ad group's campaign uses an automated bid strategy i.e., *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, *TargetCpa*, or *TargetRoas*, as these bid strategies prioritize better-performing ads.

**Add:** Optional. The default value is *OptimizeForClicks*.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="adscheduleusesearchertimezone"></a>Ad Schedule Use Searcher Time Zone
Determines whether to use the account time zone or the time zone of the search user where the ads could be delivered.

Set this property to *TRUE* if you want the ads to be shown in the search user's time zone, and otherwise set it to *FALSE*.  

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *TRUE* will be set and the search user's time zone will be used. After September 30, 2020, if you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* is set and the account time zone is used.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.   
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="bidadjustment"></a>Bid Adjustment
The percent amount by which to adjust your bid for audience ads above or below the base ad group or keyword bid.

> [!NOTE]
> This property is not available with [smart shopping campaigns](../guides/smart-shopping-campaigns.md). 

Supported values are negative one hundred (-100) through positive nine hundred (900). Setting the bid adjustment to -100 percent will prevent audience ads from showing for this ad group.

Set this field to zero (0) if you do not want any bid adjustment for audience ads. If this field is empty you will inherit the *Bid Adjustment* setting of the ad group's [Campaign](campaign.md).

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If the ad group already has an audience ads bid adjustment, and you want to remove it to effectively inherit the *Bid Adjustment* setting of the ad group's [Campaign](campaign.md), set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting.   
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="bidboostvalue"></a>Bid Boost Value
The default bid boost percentage that you'll see in the Microsoft Advertising web application for new product groups. 

This ad group level target setting is not used directly in the auction. The product group [Bid Adjustment](ad-group-product-partition.md#bidadjustment) is used to boost your partner's [Bid](ad-group-product-partition.md#bid).

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is only applicable for ad groups in [Shopping Campaigns for Brands](../guides/product-ads.md#setup-cooperative).

**Add:** Required if the [Bid Option](#bidoption) is set to BidBoost, and otherwise you may not set this field.  
**Update:** Optional if the [Bid Option](#bidoption) is set to BidBoost, and otherwise you may not set this field.       
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="bidoption"></a>Bid Option
Determines whether or not to amplify your partner's bid.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is only applicable for ad groups in [Shopping Campaigns for Brands](../guides/product-ads.md#setup-cooperative).

Supported values are BidBoost and BidValue. A bid value ad group allows you to bid on products that your merchandising partner doesn't target. A bid boost allows you to amplify your partner's bid via the product group's [Bid Adjustment](ad-group-product-partition.md#bidadjustment) field (please also see ad group [Bid Boost Value](#bidboostvalue)) and the ad group's [Maximum Bid](#maximumbid) fields. You should only use BidBoost if your partner uses BidValue. 

Please take note of the following impact this setting has on biddable [Ad Group Product Partition](ad-group-product-partition.md) records i.e., where the [Is Excluded](ad-group-product-partition.md#isexcluded) field is *FALSE* and the [Sub Type](ad-group-product-partition.md#subtype) is *Unit*.
- If this element is set to BidValue, the auction will use use the [Bid](ad-group-product-partition.md#bid) field of the [Ad Group Product Partition](ad-group-product-partition.md).
- If this element is set to BidBoost, the auction will use use the [Bid Adjustment](ad-group-product-partition.md#bidadjustment) field of the [Ad Group Product Partition](ad-group-product-partition.md).  

**Add:** Optional. If this field is not set, the default [Shopping Campaigns for Brands](../guides/product-ads.md#setup-cooperative) bidding option for the ad group is BidValue.    
**Update:** Read-only. If you attempt to change the previous bid option an error will be returned.     
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="bidstrategytype"></a>Bid Strategy Type
The bid strategy type for how you want to manage your bids. 

The bid strategy type for ad groups and keywords is "InheritFromParent".

> [!NOTE]
> As of April 2021, you cannot set any bid strategies for ad groups or keywords. If you attempt to set bid strategies for ad groups or keywords, the request will be ignored without error. Ad groups and keywords will inherit their campaign's bid strategy.

For details about supported bid strategies per campaign type, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). 

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, then *InheritFromParent* is used by default.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the ad group.

**Add:** Read-only and Required  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Campaign](#campaign) field.

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="cpcbid"></a>Cpc Bid
The default bid to use when the user’s query and the ad group’s keywords match by using either a broad, exact, or phrase match comparison.

The minimum and maximum bid range depends on the account's currency. For more information, see [Currencies](../guides/currencies.md).

Specifying a broad, exact, or phrase match bid at the keyword level overrides the ad group’s search bid value for the corresponding match type.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set a bid, it will be set to the minimum depending on your account's currency.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.  

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 250 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="enddate"></a>End Date
The date that the ads in the ad group will expire.

If you do not specify an end date, the ads will not expire. The end date can be extended to make an ad group's ads eligible for delivery, even after the ad group expires.

The end date is inclusive. For example, if you set *End Date* to 12/31/2020, the ads in the ad group will expire at 11:59 PM on 12/31/2020. The time is based on the time zone that you specify at the campaign level.

**Add:** Optional. To set no end date when adding an ad group, do not set this field.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To delete the current end date and effectively set no end date, set this field to the "delete_value" string. When you retrieve the ad group next time, this field will not be set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>Final Url Suffix
The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad group.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad group can then be referenced in the *Parent Id* field of dependent record types such as ads, keywords, or criterion. This is recommended if you are adding new ad groups and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

## <a name="inheritedbidstrategytype"></a>Inherited Bid Strategy Type
The bid strategy type that is inherited from the parent campaign. 

This value is equal to the parent campaign's [Bid Strategy Type](#bidstrategytype) field. Possible values are *EnhancedCpc*, *ManualCpc*, *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, *TargetCpa*, and *TargetRoas*.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="keywordrelevance"></a>Keyword Relevance
A numeric score that indicates how likely your ads will be clicked and how well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. This score predicts whether your keyword is likely to lead to a click on your ads, taking into account how well your keyword has performed in the past relative to your ad's position.

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword Relevance is equivalent to the **Expected Click-Through Rate** label used in the Microsoft Advertising web application.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.

**Add:** Read-only    
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="landingpagerelevance"></a>Landing Page Relevance
A numeric score that indicates how relevant your ad and landing page are to the customer's search query or other input.

> [!NOTE]
> Landing Page Relevance is equivalent to the **Ad Relevance** label used in the Microsoft Advertising web application.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.

## <a name="landingpageuserexperience"></a>Landing Page User Experience
A numeric score that indicates whether your landing page is likely to provide a good experience to customers who click your ad and land on your website.

> [!NOTE]
> Landing Page User Experience is equivalent to the **Landing Page Experience** label used in the Microsoft Advertising web application.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.

**Add:** Read-only    
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="language"></a>Language
Your [ad language](../guides/ad-languages.md#adlanguage) setting determines the language you will use when you write your ads and should be the language of your customers.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If languages are set at both the ad group and campaign level, the ad group level language will override the campaign level language. 

The supported language strings for Search and Shopping campaigns are: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, and TraditionalChinese.

> [!NOTE]
> The following languages are not yet available for everyone: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Greek, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian.

For Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, the campaign and ad group level language settings are ignored in favor of the website [domain language](campaign.md#domainlanguage). You should set campaign [languages](campaign.md#language) to "All" and leave the ad group level language empty.

For ad groups in Audience campaigns, ad group level language is not supported, and you must set the [Language](campaign.md#language) field of the ad group's campaign to "All".

**Add:** Optional if the campaign has one or more languages set, and otherwise the language is required for most campaign types. You are not allowed to set this element for ad groups in Audience campaigns.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove the language and defer to the campaign level languages, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="maximumbid"></a>Maximum Bid
The flat amount of your bid for [Shopping Campaigns for Brands](../guides/product-ads.md#setup-cooperative).

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is only applicable for ad groups in [Shopping Campaigns for Brands](../guides/product-ads.md#setup-cooperative).

**Add:** Required if the [Bid Option](#bidoption) is set to BidBoost, and otherwise you may not set this field.  
**Update:** Optional if the [Bid Option](#bidoption) is set to BidBoost, and otherwise you may not set this field.       
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="networkdistribution"></a>Network Distribution
The search networks where you want your ads to display.

Supported network values for ad groups within most campaign types are *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*, *OwnedAndOperatedOnly*, and *SyndicatedSearchOnly*. The default is *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*. For more information about networks and ad distribution, see the [About Ad Distribution](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50871/0) help article.

For ad groups in Audience campaigns, ad group level network is not supported and this field will be empty. The ad groups are in the Microsoft Audience Network.

For ad groups in [smart shopping campaigns](../guides/smart-shopping-campaigns.md), you cannot set the network. The service will set the network to *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*. 

For ad groups in [shopping campaigns for brands](../guides/product-ads.md#setup-cooperative), the *InHousePromotion* network (Retailer Network only) is supported in addition to *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*, *OwnedAndOperatedOnly*, and *SyndicatedSearchOnly*.

If you select one of the syndicated search options, you can call the [SetNegativeSitesToAdGroups](../campaign-management-service/setnegativesitestoadgroups.md) or [SetNegativeSitesToCampaigns](../campaign-management-service/setnegativesitestocampaigns.md) operation to prevent the ads from displaying on specific syndicated search websites.

|-----|-----|
|<a name="active"></a>Active|The ad group is eligible to serve.|
|<a name="pending"></a>Pending|The privacy evaluation is still in progress, and the ad group is not yet eligible to serve.|
|<a name="targetingtoonarrow"></a>TargetingTooNarrow|The ad group is not eligible to serve because your ad group target criteria e.g., [Ad Group Company Name Criterion](ad-group-company-name-criterion.md) are too narrowly defined.

## <a name="qualityscore"></a>Quality Score
The numeric score shows you how competitive your ads are in the marketplace by measuring how relevant your keywords and landing pages are to customers' search terms. The quality score is calculated by Microsoft Advertising using the *Keyword Relevance*, *Landing Page Relevance*, and *Landing Page User Experience* sub scores. If available, the quality score can range from a low of 1 to a high of 10.

Quality score is based on the last rolling 30 days for the owned and operated search traffic. A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. Traffic for syndicated networks do not affect quality score. The value in the file will be "" (empty string) if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more.<br/><br/>Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day.

If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period. Use the historic quality score to find out how quality score may have changed over time. Historical quality score is a daily snapshot of the rolling quality score. For more information on historic quality score, see the *HistoricalQualityScore* column in [Report Attributes and Performance Statistics](../guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md).

## <a name="startdate"></a>Start Date
The date that the ads in the ad group can begin serving; otherwise, the service can begin serving the ads in the ad group the day that the ad group becomes active.

The start date is inclusive. For example, if you set *Start Date* to 5/5/2020, the ads in the ad group will start at 12:00 AM on 5/5/2020. The time is based on the time zone that you specify at the campaign level.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field or if the date you submit is prior to today's date, then today's date will be set and the service can begin serving the ads in the ad group as soon as the ad group status is active.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. The start date cannot be updated after the ad group is submitted i.e., once the start date has arrived.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="status"></a>Status
The status of the ad group.

Possible values are *Active*, *Deleted*, *Expired*, and *Paused*. The *Expired* status is read-only.

**Add:** Optional. The default value is *Paused*.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Required. The Status must be set to Deleted.

## <a name="targetsetting"></a>Target Setting
The target settings that are applicable for criterion types e.g., audiences that are associated with this ad group. 

Include the criterion type group name in this field if you want the "target and bid" option. In this case we will only deliver ads to people who meet at least one of your criteria, while letting you make bid adjustments for specific criteria. 

Exclude the criterion type group name from this field if you want the "bid only" option. In this case we will deliver ads to everyone who meets your other targeting criteria, while letting you make bid adjustments for specific criteria.

Each criterion type group name is delimited in the Bulk file by a semicolon (";"), for example *Age;Audience;CompanyName;Gender;Industry;JobFunction*. When you download the Bulk file, only the types that are setup to use the "target and bid" option will be included in this field.

If the [Campaign Type](campaign.md#campaigntype) is set to Audience, the supported values for this field are Age, Audience, CompanyName, Gender, Industry, and JobFunction. Otherwise the only value currently supported for other campaign types e.g., Search campaigns is "Audience". In other words, the "target and bid" option for the Audience criterion type is supported with all campaign types, whereas the "target and bid" option for Age, CompanyName, Gender, Industry, and JobFunction criterion groups is only supported with the Audience campaign type. New values may be supported in the future so you should not depend on a fixed set of values. Having said that, any possible values for this field should also be defined in the [CriterionTypeGroup](../campaign-management-service/criteriontypegroup.md) value set of the Campaign Management API. 

> [!NOTE]
> Do not confuse the Audience campaign type with the Audience criterion type group name.

An entity such as a remarketing list can be associated with multiple ad groups, and each ad group's target settings (e.g., the Audience criterion group name for remarketing lists) are applied independently for delivery. For example the same remarketing list can be associated with Ad Group A and Ad Group B. The Target Setting field for each ad group are set independently, and therefore the same remarketing list might be associated via the "target and bid" option for Ad Group A while associated via the "bid only" option for Ad Group B. 

**Add:** Optional. If the criterion type group name is excluded from this field, then the default setting is effectively "bid only".  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all criterion type group names, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of criterion type group names, specify the criterion type group names that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of criterion type group names will replace any previous criterion groups that were set for the ad group.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for all URLs in your ad group.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.  
**Delete:** Read-only
