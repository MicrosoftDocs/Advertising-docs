# Campaign Negative Keyword Record - Bulk
Defines a negative keyword assigned to a campaign that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

In the bulk schema each of the negative keywords associated with a campaign are represented individually by their own row. For example if a campaign has two negative keywords, they are represented by two *Campaign Negative Keyword* records in the bulk file with *Status* set to Active.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Campaign Negative Keyword* can be added and deleted, but cannot be updated.

You can download all *Campaign Negative Keyword* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CampaignNegativeKeywords* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new campaign negative keyword if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Keyword,Match Type,Name
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,6.0
Campaign Negative Keyword,Active,,-112,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,shoes,Exact,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkCampaignNegativeKeyword* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCampaignNegativeKeyword
var bulkCampaignNegativeKeyword = new BulkCampaignNegativeKeyword
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignId = campaignIdKey,
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = null,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // NegativeKeyword object of the Campaign Management service.
    NegativeKeyword = new NegativeKeyword
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Match Type' column header in the Bulk file
        MatchType = MatchType.Exact,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "shoes"
    },
                
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCampaignNegativeKeyword);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

For a *Campaign Negative Keyword* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Id](#id)
- [Keyword](#keyword)
- [Match Type](#matchtype)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Status](#status)

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign

**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Campaign](#campaign) field.

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id

**Add:** Optional

## <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="parentid"></a>Parent Id
The system-generated identifier of the campaign that contains the negative keyword.

This bulk field maps to the *Id* field of the [Campaign](campaign.md) record.

**Add:** Read-only and Required. You must either specify an existing campaign identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Campaign](campaign.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new negative keywords to a new campaign in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Not applicable. A negative keyword can be added and deleted, but cannot be updated.  
**Delete:** Read-only

## <a name="status"></a>Status
Represents the association status between the campaign and the negative keyword.

If the negative keyword is associated with the campaign, this  field's value is *Active*.

Possible values are *Active* or *Deleted*. 

**Add:** Optional. The default value is *Active*.  
**Update:** Not applicable. A negative keyword can be added and deleted, but cannot be updated.    
**Delete:** Required. The Status must be set to *Deleted*. To delete a specific negative keyword, you must upload the [Status](#status), [Id](#id), and [Parent Id](#parentid). To delete all negative keywords for the campaign, you only need to upload the [Status](#status) and [Parent Id](#parentid) in a single record. Then optionally you can add new negative keyword records to replace the deleted set.
