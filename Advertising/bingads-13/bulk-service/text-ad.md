# Text Ad Record - Bulk
Defines a text ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Beginning April 2020, delivery of standart text ads (STA) is not supported.  
> 
> Standard Text Ads have been deprecated in favor of Expanded Text Ads (EXTAs). Support for adding and updating standard text ads (STAs) ended on July 31, 2017. Now, advertisers can get and delete, but can no longer add new STAs or update existing standard text ads. One exception to the rule, is that you can still update the STA status e.g. from *Active* to *Paused*. Otherwise attempts to add or update STAs will result in the *CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid* error. 

You can download all *Text Ad* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *TextAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new text ad if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,
Text Ad,Active,,-1111,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameGoesHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,Contoso Quick Setup,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,contoso.com,,,All,False,,,,https://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale,https://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkTextAd* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkTextAd
var bulkTextAd = new BulkTextAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameGoesHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // TextAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    TextAd = new TextAd
    {
        // 'Ad Format Preference' column header in the Bulk file
        AdFormatPreference = "All",
        // 'Destination Url' column header in the Bulk file
        DestinationUrl = null,
        // 'Device Preference' column header in the Bulk file
        DevicePreference = 0,
        // 'Display Url' column header in the Bulk file
        DisplayUrl = "contoso.com",
        // 'Mobile Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalMobileUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "https://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale"
        },
        // 'Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "https://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale"
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales!",
        // 'Title' column header in the Bulk file
        Title = "Contoso Quick Setup",
        // 'Tracking Template' column header in the Bulk file
        TrackingUrlTemplate = null,
        // 'Custom Parameter' column header in the Bulk file
        UrlCustomParameters = new CustomParameters
        {
            // Each custom parameter is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            Parameters = new[] {
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "promoCode",
                    Value = "PROMO1"
                },
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "season",
                    Value = "summer"
                },
            }
        },
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkTextAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

## <a name="adformatpreference"></a>Ad Format Preference
The *Ad Format Preference* field is used to indicate whether or not you prefer the ad copy to be shown to users as a search or audience ad. Search ads tend to be written as a call to action, whereas audience ads should be written in more of an informational style. While you have the option to use search text ads as audience ads, designating an ad as Audience ads preferred format allows you to optimize its messaging for native delivery. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must define at least one text ad per ad group that does not prefer audience ads, otherwise the ad copy of all text ads will be eligible for both search and audience ads. 

Possible values are *Audience Ad* and *All*. If set to *All*, the ad will be eligible for both search and audience ad formats. If set to *Audience Ad*, the ad will only be eligible for the audience ad format.

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id

**Add:** Not supported  
**Update:** Optional

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.  

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 250 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

The default value is *All*.

In the bulk download and upload results file, this field will never be empty. If you did not specify a device preference, the default value of *All* will be returned.

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*.

For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.
