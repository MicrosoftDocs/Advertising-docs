# Promotion Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a promotion ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

> [!NOTE]
> Promotion Extensions are available for customers in AU, CA, DE, FR, US and UK.   

You can associate a promotion ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 20 promotion ad extensions. Use the [Account Promotion Ad Extension](account-promotion-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Promotion Ad Extension](ad-group-promotion-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Promotion Ad Extension](campaign-promotion-ad-extension.md) records to manage promotion ad extension associations.

You can download all *Promotion Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *PromotionAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Promotion Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv

```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkPromotionAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, the ad extension will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar [start](#startdate) and [end](#enddate) dates.  
**Update:** Optional. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="currencycode"></a>Currency Code
The currency code for the promotion price or discount. 

This field is only applicable if you set [Money Amount Off](#moneyamountoff) or [Orders Over Amount](#ordersoveramount). 

The supported currency codes are ARS, AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CLP, CNY, COP, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, INR, MXN, NZD, PEN, PHP, PLN, SEK, SGD, USD, TWD, and VEF. 

**Add:** Required if [Money Amount Off](#moneyamountoff) or [Orders Over Amount](#ordersoveramount) are set.     
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set either [Percent Off](#percentoff) or [Promotion Code](#promotioncode), this setting is no longer applicable and will be deleted.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 3 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and any additional custom parameters will be ignored. For customers in the Custom Parameters Limit Increase Phase 3 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 635), Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned.  

- Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.  

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 200 UTF-8 bytes. For customers in the Custom Parameters Limit Increase Phase 3 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 635), the Value limit increases to 250 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="discountmodifier"></a>Discount Modifier
The promotion discount modifier.

The possible values for this field are *None* and *UpTo*. 

- None: The promotion discount is not modified.
- UpTo: The promotion discount is modified with the "Up to" string prefix. For example, if the unmodified promotion discount would be "$20 off shoes", the modified promotion is "Up to $20 off shoes".

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *None* will be set.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.  
**Delete:** Read-only

For example the ad extension passed editorial review for Canada and is still pending review in the United States.|
|<a name="editorialstatusdisapproved"></a>Disapproved|The ad extension failed editorial review.|

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="enddate"></a>End Date
The ad extension scheduled end date string formatted as *MM/DD/YYYY*.

The end date is inclusive. For example, if you set this field to 12/31/2020, the ad extensions will stop being shown at 11:59 PM on 12/31/2020.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify an end date, the ad extension will continue to be delivered unless you pause the associated campaigns, ad groups, or ads.  
**Update:** Optional. The end date can be shortened or extended, as long as the start date is either null or occurs before the new end date. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively removing the end date. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.      
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurl"></a>Final Url
The landing page URL.

The following validation rules apply to Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs.  
- The length of the URL is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.
- You may specify up to 10 list items for both [Final Url](#finalurl) and [Mobile Final Url](#mobilefinalurl); however, only the first item in each list is used for delivery. The service allows up to 10 list items for potential forward compatibility.  
- Each URL is delimited by a semicolon and space ("; ").  
- Usage of '{' and '}' is only allowed to delineate tags, for example *{lpurl}*.  
- Final URLs must each be a well-formed URL starting with either http:// or https://.

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>Final Url Suffix
The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available for customers in the Final URL Suffix Phase 3 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 636). If you are not in the pilot this property will be ignored and no error will be returned.  

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad extension.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad extension can then be referenced in the *Id* field of dependent record types such as [Ad Group Promotion Ad Extension](ad-group-promotion-ad-extension.md) and [Campaign Promotion Ad Extension](campaign-promotion-ad-extension.md). This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required

## <a name="occasion"></a>Occasion
The promotion occasion.

Both the promotion [Occasion](#occasion) and Scheduling ([Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields) fields determine when the promotion is eligible to be shown in ads.  

The promotion [Occasion](#occasion) determines the time period or seasonality e.g., [WomensDay](#womensday) from February 15 through March 31 each year. The promotion will only run within the dates corresponding to the occasion that you set. See the table below for details about the defined date range for each occasion.  

The Scheduling can limit the promotion to a shorter timeframe within the occasion's date range e.g., limit the promotion to run from February 20 through March 8. The Scheduling can also be used to run the same promotion multiple years e.g., run the [WomensDay](#womensday) promotion every year from February 15 through March 31.

If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated.

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use for your promotion URLs.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="usesearchertimezone"></a>Use Searcher Time Zone

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and the account time zone will be used.  
**Update:** Optional. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *FALSE*. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.
