# Expanded Text Ad Record - Bulk
Defines an expanded text ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

This ad format works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices so you can focus more on crafting your longer ad copy and optimizing your ad text to better engage your customers before they click your ad.

> [!NOTE]
> Expanded text ads can only be created in Search campaigns where the [Ad Group Type](ad-group.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchStandard". If the [Ad Group Type](ad-group.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchDynamic", then the ad group does not support expanded text ads.  

You can download all *Expanded Text Ad* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ExpandedTextAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new expanded text ad if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Text Part 2,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Title Part 3,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expanded Text Ad,Active,,-1111,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameGoesHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,Start Advertising on Contoso Today.,,,,,False,,,,https://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale,https://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale,,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,Contoso,Quick & Easy Setup,Seemless Integration,seattle,shoe sale
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkExpandedTextAd* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkExpandedTextAd
var bulkExpandedTextAd = new BulkExpandedTextAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameGoesHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // ExpandedTextAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    ExpandedTextAd = new ExpandedTextAd
    {
        // 'Ad Format Preference' column header in the Bulk file
        AdFormatPreference = "All",
        // 'Mobile Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalMobileUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "https://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale"
        },
        // 'Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "https://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale"
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Path 1' column header in the Bulk file
        Path1 = "seattle",
        // 'Path 2' column header in the Bulk file
        Path2 = "shoe sale",
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales!",
        // 'Text Part 2' column header in the Bulk file
        TextPart2 = "Start Advertising on Contoso Today.",
        // 'Title Part 1' column header in the Bulk file
        TitlePart1 = "Contoso",
        // 'Title Part 2' column header in the Bulk file
        TitlePart2 = "Quick & Easy Setup",
        // 'Title Part 3' column header in the Bulk file
        TitlePart3 = "Seemless Integration",
        // 'Tracking Template' column header in the Bulk file
        TrackingUrlTemplate = null,
        // 'Custom Parameter' column header in the Bulk file
        UrlCustomParameters = new CustomParameters
        {
            // Each custom parameter is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            Parameters = new[] {
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "promoCode",
                    Value = "PROMO1"
                },
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "season",
                    Value = "summer"
                },
            }
        },
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkExpandedTextAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

For an *Expanded Text Ad* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). The combination of the Final Urls, Path 1, Path2, Text, Text Part 2, Title Part 1, Title Part 2, and Title Part 3 fields make the expanded text ad unique.

## <a name="adformatpreference"></a>Ad Format Preference
The *Ad Format Preference* field is used to indicate whether or not you prefer the ad copy to be shown to users as a search or audience ad. Search ads tend to be written as a call to action, whereas audience ads should be written in more of an informational style. While you have the option to use expanded text ads as audience ads, designating an ad as Audience ads preferred format allows you to optimize its messaging for native delivery. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must define at least one expanded text ad per ad group that does not prefer audience ads, otherwise the ad copy of all expanded text ads will be eligible for both search and audience ads. 

Possible values are *Audience Ad* and *All*. If set to *All*, the ad will be eligible for both search and audience ad formats. If set to *Audience Ad*, the ad will only be eligible for the audience ad format.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field when creating an expanded text ad, by default the ad format preference will be set to *All*.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, the ad format preference will effectively be set to the default value i.e. *All*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="adgroup"></a>Ad Group
The name of the ad group that contains the ad.

**Add:** Read-only and Required  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Ad Group](#adgroup) field.

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the ad group and ad.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.  

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 250 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="domain"></a>Domain

## <a name="finalurl"></a>Final Url
The landing page URL.

The domain portion of the URL in combination with the path 1 and path 2 strings cannot exceed 67 characters.

The following validation rules apply to Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs.

- The length of the URL is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- You may specify up to 10 items for both Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs; however, only the first item in each list is used for delivery. The service allows up to 10 for potential forward compatibility.

- Each URL is delimited by a semicolon and space ("; ").

- Usage of '{' and '}' is only allowed to delineate tags, for example "{lpurl}".

- Each URL must be a well-formed URL starting with either http:// or https://.

- If you specify Final Mobile URLs, you must also specify Final Url.

Also note that  if the *Tracking Template* or *Custom Parameter* fields are set, then at least one Final URL is required.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>Final Url Suffix
The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad can then be referenced in the *Parent Id* field of dependent record types such as [Expanded Text Ad Label](expanded-text-ad-label.md#parentid). This is recommended if you are adding new ads and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

## <a name="mobilefinalurl"></a>Mobile Final Url

- Each URL is delimited by a semicolon and space ("; ").

- Usage of '{' and '}' is only allowed to delineate tags, for example "{lpurl}".

- Each URL must be a well-formed URL starting with either http:// or https://.

> [!NOTE]
> This URL is used only if the keyword does not specify a *Mobile Final Url*.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="parentid"></a>Parent Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad group that contains the ad.

This bulk field maps to the *Id* field of the [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record.

**Add:** Read-only and Required. You must either specify an existing ad group identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new ads to a new ad group in the same Bulk file.

**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Ad Group](#adgroup) field.

## <a name="path1"></a>Path 1
The first part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *https://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL (*Final Url* field).  Then if you have specified a value for *Path 1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path 2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path 1*. For example if your *Final Url* contains *https://www.contoso.com*, *Path 1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path 2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *https://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.

The path can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md). 

The path can contain dynamic parameters such as {MatchType}. For a list of supported parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).

The maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 15 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of the final URL domain and the paths combined exceed 67 characters.

For languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 7 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of the final URL domain and the paths combined exceed 33 characters. The double-width characters are determined by the characters you use instead of the character set of the campaign or ad group language settings. Double-width characters include Korean, Japanese and Chinese languages characters as well as Emojis.

The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters.

If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="path2"></a>Path 2
The second part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *https://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL (*Final Url* field).  Then if you have specified a value for *Path 1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path 2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path 1*. For example if your *Final Url* contains *https://www.contoso.com*, *Path 1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path 2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *https://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.

You can only specify *Path 2* if *Path 1* is also set.

The path can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available.

## <a name="text"></a>Text
The first part of the ad description that can show in your ad.

To maximize impressions across all ad formats the description might not always be shown in your ad.

The text must contain at least one word. For efficient use of resources we recommend that you use dynamic text strings such as {keyword} instead of creating new ad copy for each keyword. For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1).

The text can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md). 

The maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 90 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of both text parts exceed 180 characters after dynamic text substitution occurs. 

For languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length is 500 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 45 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of both text parts exceed 90 characters after dynamic text substitution occurs.

## <a name="titlepart1"></a>Title Part 1
The first part of the ad title. The three title parts will be automatically separated by a space, vertical bar, and space (" &#124; ") when the ad is shown. 

Each part of the title must contain at least one word. For efficient use of resources we recommend that you use dynamic text strings such as {keyword} instead of creating new ad copy for each keyword. For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1).

The title can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md). 

The maximum input length is 1,000 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 30 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of all three title parts exceed 90 characters after dynamic text substitution occurs. 

For languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length is 500 characters if you include dynamic text strings. No more than 15 final (not dynamic text) characters can be input. The ad will fail to display or the [default text](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1/#DefaultText) will be used if the length of all three title parts exceed 45 characters after dynamic text substitution occurs. The double-width characters are determined by the characters you use instead of the character set of the campaign or ad group language settings. Double-width characters include Korean, Japanese and Chinese languages characters as well as Emojis.

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for the URL specified with FinalUrls.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.   
**Delete:** Read-only
