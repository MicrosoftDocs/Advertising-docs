# Keyword Record - Bulk
Defines a keyword that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

You can download all *Keyword* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *Keywords* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. To include the [Keyword Relevance](#keywordrelevance), [Landing Page Relevance](#landingpagerelevance), [Landing Page User Experience](#landingpageuserexperience), and [Quality Score](#qualityscore) fields within the downloaded *Campaign* records, you must also include the [QualityScoreData](datascope.md#qualityscoredata) scope. If you also include the [BidSuggestionsData](datascope.md#bidsuggestionsdata) scope, the Bulk file can also contain separate [Keyword Best Position Bid](keyword-best-position-bid.md), [Keyword Main Line Bid](keyword-main-line-bid.md), and [Keyword First Page Bid](keyword-first-page-bid.md) records corresponding to each downloaded keyword. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new keyword if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Keyword,Match Type,Bid,Param1,Param2,Param3,Name,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Custom Parameter,Bid Strategy Type
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,
Keyword,Active,,-1111,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameGoesHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,red shoes,Broad,0.5,,,,,https://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale,https://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale,,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,ManualCpc
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkKeyword* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkKeyword
var bulkKeyword = new BulkKeyword
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameGoesHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // Keyword object of the Campaign Management service.
    Keyword = new Keyword
    {
        // 'Bid' column header in the Bulk file
        Bid = new Bid
        {
            Amount = 0.50,
        },
        // 'Bid Strategy Type' column header in the Bulk file
        BiddingScheme = new ManualCpcBiddingScheme { },
        // 'Destination Url' column header in the Bulk file
        DestinationUrl = null,
        // 'Mobile Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalMobileUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "https://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale"
        },
        // 'Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "https://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale"
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Match Type' column header in the Bulk file
        MatchType = MatchType.Broad,
        // 'Param 1 column header in the Bulk file
        Param1 = null,

        Param3 = null,
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = KeywordStatus.Active,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "red shoes",
        // 'Tracking Template' column header in the Bulk file
        TrackingUrlTemplate = null,
        // 'Custom Parameter' column header in the Bulk file
        UrlCustomParameters = new CustomParameters
        {
            // Each custom parameter is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            Parameters = new[] {
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "promoCode",
                    Value = "PROMO1"
                },
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "season",
                    Value = "summer"
                },
            }
        },
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkKeyword);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();

## <a name="adgroup"></a>Ad Group
The name of the ad group that contains the keyword.

**Add:** Read-only and Required  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Ad Group](#adgroup) field.

## <a name="bid"></a>Bid
The maximum amount that you want to pay each time someone clicks your ad.  

You bid against other advertisers using the same keyword, so in general, higher bids help get your ad to display in more desirable locations on the search results page.  

Instead of using the default ad group level bid, you can set custom bids for each keyword. Custom bids for keywords override the ad group default bid for those specific keywords. With custom bids, you can focus your time and money on the most profitable keywords but will need to spend more time on managing the individual bids.    

If the keyword level bid is not set, the Ad Group [Cpc Bid](ad-group.md#cpcbid) is used. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md).  

**Add:** Optional   
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.   
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="bidstrategytype"></a>Bid Strategy Type
The bid strategy type for how you want to manage your bids. 

The bid strategy type for ad groups and keywords is "InheritFromParent".

> [!NOTE]
> As of April 2021, you cannot set any bid strategies for ad groups or keywords. If you attempt to set bid strategies for ad groups or keywords, the request will be ignored without error. Ad groups and keywords will inherit their campaign's bid strategy.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the keyword.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.  

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 250 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="destinationurl"></a>Destination Url
The URL of the webpage to take the user to when they click the ad. The keyword's destination URL is used if specified; otherwise, the ad's destination URL is used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of November 2018 the keyword destination URL cannot be added or updated. You can use [Final Url](#finalurl) instead, otherwise Microsoft Advertising will use the ad's Final URL. For more details see [Migrating your keyword destination URLs to final URLs](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/august-2018/migrating-your-keyword-destination-urls-to-final-urls).

## <a name="finalurl"></a>Final Url
The landing page URL. The keyword's final URL is used if specified; otherwise, the ad's final URL is used.

The following validation rules apply to Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs.

- The length of the URL is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- You may specify up to 10 items for both Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs; however, only the first item in each list is used for delivery. The service allows up to 10 for potential forward compatibility.

- Each URL is delimited by a semicolon and space ("; ").

- Usage of '{' and '}' is only allowed to delineate tags, for example "{lpurl}".

- Each URL must be a well-formed URL starting with either http:// or https://.

- If you specify Final Mobile URLs, you must also specify Final Url. 

Also note that  if the *Tracking Template* or *Custom Parameter* fields are set, then the *Final Url* field is required.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>Final Url Suffix
The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides. 

**Add:** Optional

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the keyword.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the keyword can then be referenced in the *Parent Id* field of dependent record types such as [Keyword Label](keyword-label.md#parentid). This is recommended if you are adding new keywords and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required

**Update:** Read-only    
**Delete:** Read-only

## <a name="keywordrelevance"></a>Keyword Relevance
A numeric score that indicates how likely your ads will be clicked and how well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. This score predicts whether your keyword is likely to lead to a click on your ads, taking into account how well your keyword has performed in the past relative to your ad's position.

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword Relevance is equivalent to the **Expected Click-Through Rate** label used in the Microsoft Advertising web application.

A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.

Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

## <a name="param1"></a>Param1
The string to use as the substitution value in an ad if the ad's title, text, display URL, or destination URL contains the {Param1} dynamic substitution string.

> [!NOTE]
> Although you can use {Param1} to specify an ad's destination URL, you are encouraged not to. Instead, you should set the keyword's DestinationUrl element.

The string can contain a maximum of 1,022 characters. The actual limit depends on the length of the element that references the substitution string. For example, the length of a text ad's title can contain a maximum of 25 characters.

When implementing dynamic text in your ad copy you should provide a default string e.g. {Param1:default} that the system will use if Param1 for a keyword is null or empty, or if including the Param1 substitution value will cause the expanded string to exceed the element's limit; otherwise the ad will not serve with this keyword. For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1).

Also note that if the ad group only has one ad, and if that ad uses {Param1} but does not provide a default string e.g. {Param1:default}, then you must supply a valid Param1 value for that substitution. Otherwise this keyword cannot be added or updated.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="param2"></a>Param2
The string to use as the substitution value in an ad if the title, text, display URL, or destination URL contains the {Param2} dynamic substitution string.

Typically, you use the {Param2} substitution string in the title or text (ad copy description) elements of an ad.

The string can contain a maximum of 70 characters. The actual limit depends on the length of the element that references the substitution string. For example, the length of a text ad's title can contain a maximum of 25 characters.

When implementing dynamic text in your ad copy you should provide a default string e.g. {Param2:default} that the system will use if Param2 for a keyword is null or empty, or if including the Param2 substitution value will cause the expanded string to exceed the element's limit; otherwise the ad will not serve with this keyword. For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1).

Also note that if the ad group only has one ad, and if that ad uses {Param2} but does not provide a default string e.g. {Param2:default}, then you must supply a valid *Param2* value for that substitution. Otherwise this keyword cannot be added or updated. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="param3"></a>Param3
The string to use as the substitution value in an ad if the title, text, display URL, or destination URL contains the {Param3} dynamic substitution string.

Typically, you use the {Param3} substitution string in the title or text (ad copy description) elements of an ad.

The string can contain a maximum of 70 characters. The actual limit depends on the length of the element that references the substitution string. For example, the length of a text ad's title can contain a maximum of 25 characters.

When implementing dynamic text in your ad copy you should provide a default string e.g. {Param3:default} that the system will use if Param3 for a keyword is null or empty, or if including the Param3 substitution value will cause the expanded string to exceed the element's limit; otherwise the ad will not serve with this keyword. For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [Automatically customize your ads with dynamic text parameters](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50811/1).

Also note that if the ad group only has one ad, and if that ad uses {Param3} but does not provide a default string e.g. {Param3:default}, then you must supply a valid *Param3* value for that substitution. Otherwise this keyword cannot be added or updated.

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="parentid"></a>Parent Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad group that contains the keyword.

This bulk field maps to the *Id* field of the [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record.

**Add:** Read-only and Required. You must either specify an existing ad group identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new keywords to a new ad group in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).

In a bulk file, the list of publisher countries are delimited with a semicolon (;).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="qualityscore"></a>Quality Score
The numeric score shows you how competitive your ads are in the marketplace by measuring how relevant your keywords and landing pages are to customers' search terms. The quality score is calculated by Microsoft Advertising using the *Keyword Relevance*, *Landing Page Relevance*, and *Landing Page User Experience* sub scores. If available, the quality score can range from a low of 1 to a high of 10.

Quality score is based on the last rolling 30 days for the owned and operated search traffic. A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. Traffic for syndicated networks do not affect quality score. The value in the file will be "" (empty string) if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more.<br/><br/>Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day.

If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated.

If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period. Use the historic quality score to find out how quality score may have changed over time. Historical quality score is a daily snapshot of the rolling quality score. For more information on historic quality score, see the *HistoricalQualityScore* column in [Report Attributes and Performance Statistics](../guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md).

**Add:** Read-only    
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="status"></a>Status
The status of the keyword.

Possible values are *Active*, *Paused*, *Inactive*, or *Deleted*.

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for the URL specified with FinalUrls.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only
