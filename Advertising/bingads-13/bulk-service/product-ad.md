# Product Ad Record - Bulk
Defines a product ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

A product ad is not used directly for delivered ad copy.  Instead, the delivery engine generates product ads from the product details that it finds in the customer’s Microsoft Merchant Center store catalog.

You can download all *Product Ad* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ProductAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new product ad if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,
Product Ad,Active,,-1112,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameGoesHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,,,,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkProductAd* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkProductAd
var bulkProductAd = new BulkProductAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameGoesHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // ProductAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    ProductAd = new ProductAd
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Promotion' column header in the Bulk file
        PromotionalText = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales!",
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkProductAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
