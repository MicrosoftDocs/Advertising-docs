# In Market Audience Record - Bulk
Defines an in-market audience that can be downloaded in a bulk file. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States. 

> [!NOTE]
> Bulk upload is not supported. You cannot add, update, or delete an in-market audience using the Bing Ads API. Having said that, you can add and delete in-market audience associations and exclusions. 
> Bing Ads API will always return all currently active in-market audiences. The service does not return deleted in-market audiences, or any delta download to see what changed. 
> The in-market audiences returned via Bing Ads API is a union of all available in-market audiences across all markets e.g., AU, CA, DE, FR, UK, and US. The [Audience Network Size](#audiencenetworksize) and [Audience Search Size](#audiencesearchsize) are a sum of lists sizes across all supported markets for a given in-market audience in the corresponding network. The Bing Ads API does not provide details of list sizes per market. For example the "Advertising and Marketing" in-market audience size in the search network might be returned as 17070879 (17.1M) via the Bing Ads API. The breakdown per market shown in the Microsoft Advertising web application might be: 2.88M in US; 474K in AU; 13.7M in UK.   
> You should not take any dependencies on the sandbox in-market audiences. Some in-market audiences are available in sandbox, but not in production. The in-market audience property values can also differ between sandbox and production e.g., the audience name and size. 

> [!TIP]
> For an overview and more information about audiences, see the [Audience APIs](../guides/universal-event-tracking.md#audience) technical guide. 

You can download all *In Market Audience* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *InMarketAudiences* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following is a Bulk CSV example download for in-market audience. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Client Id,Modified Time,Name,Description,Membership Duration,Scope,Audience,Supported Campaign Types
Format Version,,,,,,6.0,,,,,
In Market Audience,Active,IdHere,ParentIdHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,In Market Audience Description,30,Account,In Market Audience,Search;DynamicSearchAds;Shopping;Audience
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to download the *BulkInMarketAudience* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkInMarketAudience
var bulkInMarketAudience = new BulkInMarketAudience
{
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // InMarketAudience object of the Campaign Management service.
    InMarketAudience = new InMarketAudience
    {
        // 'Audience Network Size' column header in the Bulk file
        AudienceNetworkSize = null,
        // 'Description' column header in the Bulk file
        Description = "In Market Audience Description",
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = InMarketAudienceIdKey,
        // 'Membership Duration' column header in the Bulk file
        MembershipDuration = 30,
        // 'Audience' column header in the Bulk file
        Name = "In Market Audience",
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        ParentId = accountIdKey,
        // 'Scope' column header in the Bulk file
        Scope = EntityScope.Account,
        // 'Audience Search Size' column header in the Bulk file
        SearchSize = null,
        // 'Supported Campaign Types' column header in the Bulk file
        SupportedCampaignTypes = null,
    },
                
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};
```
