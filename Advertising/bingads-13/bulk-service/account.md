# Account Record - Bulk
Defines an account that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.   

> [!NOTE]
> Only super admin and standard users can update an account.

The *Account* record is included in the Bulk download file automatically everytime you call the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. 

The following is a Bulk CSV example download for account. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Ad Group,Website,Sync Time,Client Id,Modified Time,MSCLKID Auto Tagging Enabled,Include View Through Conversions,Profile Expansion Enabled,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Name
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,true,,,,,6.0
Account,,111,222,,,,,02/12/2019 15:32:34,,,true,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to download the *BulkAccount* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

For an *Account* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Allow Image Auto Retrieve](#allowimageautoretrieve)
- [Auto Apply Recommendations](#autoapplyrecommendations)
- [Final Url Suffix](#finalurlsuffix)
- [Id](#id)
- [Include View Through Conversions](#includeviewthroughconversions)
- [MSCLKID Auto Tagging Enabled](#msclkidautotaggingenabled)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Profile Expansion Enabled](#profileexpansionenabled)
- [Sync Time](#synctime)
- [Tracking Template](#trackingtemplate)


## <a name="allowimageautoretrieve"></a>Allow Image Auto Retrieve
Determines whether Microsoft Advertising is allowed to use images from your domain to enhance your ads on the Microsoft Audience Network.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By opting-in, you agree that any images or creative content retrieved from the Advertiser landing page is content "provided by" the Advertiser under the content usage license in the [Advertising Agreement](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/microsoft-advertising-agreement) (Section 2) and that the Advertiser agrees that Microsoft can use that content for auto-creating ads and extensions for them.

[!INCLUDE[coming-soon](./includes/coming-soon.md)]

If this field is set to *true*, then the image auto-retrieve feature is enabled. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.     

## <a name="autoapplyrecommendations"></a>Auto Apply Recommendations
Determines whether Microsoft Advertising is allowed to automatically apply ad recommendations meant to help you boost ad performance.  

[!INCLUDE[coming-soon](./includes/coming-soon.md)]

We'll let you know when suggested ads are ready for you to review. You can find ad recommendations on the Recommendations page. If you don't take action, we'll automatically apply them after the review period:

- Multimedia ads: 7 days
- All others: 14 days

You can change your auto-apply options at any time. If you don't choose to auto-apply ad recommendations, you'll still be able to apply recommendations manually.

This field includes a list of recommendation types.  

The list of key and value pairs are delimited with a semicolon (;). In this example, auto-apply ad recommendations is enabled for multimedia ads but not for responsive search ads or expanded text ads.  

```
MultimediaAdsAutoApply=true;ResponsiveSearchAdsAutoApply=false;ExpandedTextAdsAutoApply=false
```

The default key and value pairs are:

- MultimediaAdsAutoApply=true;
- ResponsiveSearchAdsAutoApply=false;
- ExpandedTextAdsAutoApply=false

If the value of a key is set to *true*, then the auto-apply feature is enabled for the recommendation type. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. You can choose to set only the key and value pairs that you want to update. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.   

## <a name="businessattributes"></a>Business Attributes
Allows you to highlight one or more key business values meant to help you boost ad performance. 

If an attribute value is in this field, then it is selected; attributes not present are not selected. 

The possible values include: AlcoholFree, AllergyFriendly, BlackOwned, CarbonNegative, CarbonNeutral, CrueltyFree, EcoFriendly, FamilyFriendly, FamilyOwned, GlutenFree, Halal, HearingAssistance, Kosher, LocalBusiness, LGBTQIFriendly, LGBTQIOwned, MinorityOwned, MobilityAssistance, NoContactDelivery, Nonprofit, PetFriendly, SmallBusiness, SupportACure, SupportDiseaseResearch, Sustainable, Vegan, Vegetarian, VisualAssistance, TouchlessPickup, Unisex, WebAccessibility, and WheelchairAccessible. 

The list of business attributes are delimited with a semicolon (;). In this example, Alcohol-free, Family-owned, and Vegan are the selected business attributes.  

```
AlcoholFree;FamilyOwned;Vegan 
```

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. 

## <a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>Final Url Suffix
The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. 

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Bulk API only supports one account per file. This field is ignored during upload, and effectively set to the account ID that is specified in the [GetBulkUploadUrl](../bulk-service/getbulkuploadurl.md) service request.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only   

## <a name="includeviewthroughconversions"></a>Include View Through Conversions
Determines whether you want to include view-through conversions for campaigns in the account. 

View-through conversions are conversions that people make after they have seen your ad, even though they did not click the ad.

If the value is *true*, then view-through conversions will be included. By default this property is set *true*, meaning that the values in the "All" conversions columns of your performance reports will include view-through conversions. You can choose to disable it if you don't want to include view-through conversions. 

> [!NOTE]
> View-through conversions require a [UETTag](../campaign-management-service/uettag.md), so this property is not applicable for the [AppInstallGoal](../campaign-management-service/appinstallgoal.md), [InStoreTransactionGoal](../campaign-management-service/instoretransactiongoal.md), and [OfflineConversionGoal](../campaign-management-service/offlineconversiongoal.md). 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.     

## <a name="msclkidautotaggingenabled"></a>MSCLKID Auto Tagging Enabled
Determines whether auto-tagging of the MSCLKID query string parameter is enabled. The MSCLKID is a 32-character GUID that is unique for each ad click.

You might want to enable auto-tagging of MSCLKID for tracking leads via offline conversion goals. If auto-tagging of MSCLKID is enabled, the MSCLKID is automatically appended to the landing page URL when a customer clicks on your ad. For example, *www.contoso.com/?msclkid={msclkid}*. The click ID is unique for each ad click and multiple clicks on the same ad from the same user will result in multiple click IDs.

If the value is *True*, then the MSCLKID auto tagging feature is enabled. Otherwise the MSCLKID auto tagging feature is not enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every time you add or update a new [DurationGoal](../campaign-management-service/durationgoal.md), [EventGoal](../campaign-management-service/eventgoal.md), [OfflineConversionGoal](../campaign-management-service/offlineconversiongoal.md), [PagesViewedPerVisitGoal](../campaign-management-service/pagesviewedpervisitgoal.md) or [UrlGoal](../campaign-management-service/urlgoal.md) via either the Microsoft Advertising web application or Campaign Management API, the *MSCLKID Auto Tagging Enabled* field is set to *True* automatically. For more information, see [Tracking offline conversions](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56852/2).

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.     

## <a name="parentid"></a>Parent Id
The system-generated identifier of the customer that contains the account.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="profileexpansionenabled"></a>Profile Expansion Enabled
Determines whether to expand LinkedIn profile targeting across your account to reach additional customers similar to the ones you currently target. 

Enabling profile targeting expansion allows Microsoft Advertising to show your ads to additional customers similar to the ones you currently target. For example, if you target a specific LinkedIn audience segment, we will also target Bing users who don't have a confirmed LinkedIn account but who share the same characteristics as LinkedIn users in that segment. 

If the value is *true*, then the LinkedIn profile targeting expansion feature is enabled. 

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.     

## <a name="synctime"></a>Sync Time
Where the Account row intersects with the Sync Time column, the field value is represented as **MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM**, or month, day, year, hour, and minute relative to the UTC time zone. Save this value and use it with the bulk service to only get the changes between the current and the next download.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for all URLs in your account.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.
