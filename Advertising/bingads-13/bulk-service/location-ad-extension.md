# Location Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a location ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

You can associate a location ad extension with the account or with campaigns in the account. Each entity (account or campaign) can be associated with as many location ad extensions as you decide, up to the total number of location ad extensions in your account. Use the [Account Location Ad Extension](account-location-ad-extension.md) and [Campaign Location Ad Extension](campaign-location-ad-extension.md) records to manage location ad extension associations.

You can download all *Location Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *LocationAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Location Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Business Name,Phone Number,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Address Line 1,Address Line 2,Postal Code,City,State Or Province Code,Province Name,Latitude,Longitude,Country Code
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,
Location Ad Extension,Active,-15,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2020,Contoso Shoes,206-555-0100,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,1234 Washington Place,Suite 1210,98608,Woodinville,,WA,0,0,US
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkLocationAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkLocationAdExtension
var bulkLocationAdExtension = new BulkLocationAdExtension

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, the ad extension will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar [start](#startdate) and [end](#enddate) dates.  
**Update:** Optional. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad extension.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad extension can then be referenced in the *Id* field of dependent record types such as [Campaign Location Ad Extension](campaign-location-ad-extension.md). This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

## <a name="latitude"></a>Latitude
The latitude specified in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -85 and less than or equal to +85.

> [!NOTE]
> The Campaign Management service uses micro degrees i.e., from -85000000 to 85000000. When you use the BulkLocationAdExtension via the SDKs you should use micro degrees, because the BulkLocationAdExtension implementation converts from micro degrees and writes the value as degrees in the Bulk file. 

The latitude and longitude coordinates are used to mark the business' location on Bing Maps when the user clicks the address on the ad. If the specified coordinates are not within the range of valid values, the service determines the coordinates based on the address.

If you specify the known coordinates, the service does not confirm whether the specified coordinates match the specified business address. If you do not provide the coordinates, the Bulk service uses the businesses' address to determine the coordinates.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding more than 10 location ad extensions, the service resolves coordinates offline, and otherwise resolves coordinates up front during execution of the service operation. The location will not be used in an ad until the coordinates are determined, which can take from seconds to minutes depending on the number of location ad extensions being added and the current demand.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="longitude"></a>Longitude
The longitude specified in degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180 and less than or equal to +180.

> [!NOTE]
> The Campaign Management service uses micro degrees i.e., from -180000000 to 180000000. When you use the BulkLocationAdExtension via the SDKs you should use micro degrees, because the BulkLocationAdExtension implementation converts from micro degrees and writes the value as degrees in the Bulk file. 

The latitude and longitude coordinates are used to mark the business' location on Bing Maps when the user clicks the address on the ad. If the specified coordinates are not within the range of valid values, the service determines the coordinates based on the address.

If you specify the known coordinates, the service does not confirm whether the specified coordinates match the specified business address. If you do not provide the coordinates, the Bulk service uses the businesses' address to determine the coordinates.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding more than 10 location ad extensions, the service resolves coordinates offline, and otherwise resolves coordinates up front during execution of the service operation. The location will not be used in an ad until the coordinates are determined, which can take from seconds to minutes depending on the number of location ad extensions being added and the current demand.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only

If the campaign also includes a call extension, the phone number in the call extension will override the location ad extension's phone number.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.     
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="postalcode"></a>Postal Code
The postal or zip code.

The postal code can contain a maximum of 80 characters.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify a start date, the ad extension is immediately eligible to be [scheduled](#adschedule).  
**Update:** Optional. The start date can be shortened or extended, as long as the end date is either null or occurs after the new start date. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively removing the start date and the ad extension is immediately eligible to be [scheduled](#adschedule). The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.

## <a name="usesearchertimezone"></a>Use Searcher Time Zone
Determines whether to use the account time zone or the time zone of the search user where the ads could be delivered.

Set this property to *TRUE* if you want the ad extensions to be shown in the search user's time zone, and otherwise set it to *FALSE*.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and the account time zone will be used.  
**Update:** Optional. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *FALSE*. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.
