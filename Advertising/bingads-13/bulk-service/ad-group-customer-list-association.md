# Ad Group Customer List Association Record - Bulk
Defines an Ad Group Customer List Association that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file. 

Audience targets cannot be set both campaign and ad group level. If you set any biddable campaign level audience criteria, then you cannot set any biddable ad group level audience criteria. Audience exclusions can be set at both campaign and ad group level. Microsoft Advertising applies a union of both campaign and ad group level exclusions.

> [!TIP]
> For an overview and more information about audiences, see the [Audience APIs](../guides/universal-event-tracking.md#audience) technical guide. 

You can download all *Ad Group Customer List Association* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroupCustomerListAssociations* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group customer list association if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Bid Adjustment,Name,Audience Id,Audience
Format Version,,,,,,,,,6.0,,
Ad Group Customer List Association,Paused,,-1111,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,10,,CustomerListIdHere,My Customer List
```

For an *Ad Group Customer List Association* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Audience](#audience)
- [Audience Id](#audienceid)
- [Bid Adjustment](#bidadjustment)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Status](#status)

## <a name="adgroup"></a>Ad Group
The name of the ad group that is associated with the customer list.

**Add:** Read-only and Required  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Ad Group](#adgroup) field.  

## <a name="audience"></a>Audience
The name of the customer list.

This bulk field maps to the *Audience* field of the [Customer List](customer-list.md) record.

**Add:** Read-only and Required for some use cases. You must either specify the [Audience](#audience) or [Audience Id](#audienceid) field. If you are adding new ad group customer list associations with new customer lists in the same Bulk file, and if you do not set the [Audience Id](#audienceid) field, then this [Audience](#audience) field must be set as a logical key to the same value as the *Audience* field of the [Customer List](customer-list.md) record. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="audienceid"></a>Audience Id
The Microsoft Advertising identifier of the customer list associated with the ad group.

This bulk field maps to the *Id* field of the [Customer List](customer-list.md) record.

**Add:** Read-only and Required for some use cases. You must either specify the [Audience](#audience) or [Audience Id](#audienceid) field. If you set the [Audience Id](#audienceid) field, you must either specify an existing customer list identifier or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Customer List](customer-list.md) record. If the [Audience Id](#audienceid) field is not set, then you must set the [Audience](#audience) field as a logical key to the same value as the *Audience* field of the [Customer List](customer-list.md) record. Any of these options are recommended if you are adding new ad group customer list associations with new customer lists in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="bidadjustment"></a>Bid Adjustment
The percentage you want to increase/decrease the bid amount for the customer list.

Supported values are negative ninety (-90.00) through positive nine hundred (900.00).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If not specified, the default bid adjustment value is *0*. The default value is subject to change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Advertising won't apply any bid boosts until the associated customer list has at least 1,000 users. If someone qualifies to be part of multiple customer lists AND the customer lists are associated with the same ad group with different bid adjustments, the highest bid adjustment will be applied.
