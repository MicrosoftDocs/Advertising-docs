# Flyer Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a flyer ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

A flyer ad extension pairs one header with between 3 and 10 clickable text values that tell customers more about your business. 

> [!NOTE]
> Flyer Extensions are available for customers in the feature pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 802).  

You can associate a flyer ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 20 flyer ad extensions. An expanded text ad will only include one flyer (one headline with 3 - 10 values) per impression. Use the [Account Flyer Ad Extension](account-flyer-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Flyer Ad Extension](ad-group-flyer-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Flyer Ad Extension](campaign-flyer-ad-extension.md) records to manage flyer ad extension associations.

You can download all *Flyer Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *FlyerAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Flyer Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Store Id,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Flyer Name,Description,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Media Ids,Media Urls
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,
Flyer Ad Extension,Active,-18,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2020,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,Flyer name goes here, Flyer description goes here,https://www.contoso.com/one; https://www.contoso.com/two; https://www.contoso.com/three,https://mobile.contoso.com/one; https://mobile.contoso.com/two; https://mobile.contoso.com/three,12345678,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkFlyerAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkFlyerAdExtension

        Description = "Flyer description",

- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Description](#description)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

If you leave both of these fields empty during update, then neither of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for each of these fields are removed or replaced.    
**Delete:** Read-only
