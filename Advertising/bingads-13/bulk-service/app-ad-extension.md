# App Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines an app ad extension that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

You can associate an app ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with as many app ad extensions as you decide, up to the total number of app ad extensions in your account. Use the [Account App Ad Extension](account-app-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group App Ad Extension](ad-group-app-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign App Ad Extension](campaign-app-ad-extension.md) records to manage app ad extension associations.

You can download all *App Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AppAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new app ad extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Text,Destination Url,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,App Platform,App Id,Final Url Suffix
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,
App Ad Extension,Active,-11,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2020,Contoso,DestinationUrlGoesHere,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,Windows,AppStoreIdGoesHere,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkAppAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAppAdExtension
var bulkAppAdExtension = new BulkAppAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // AppAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    AppAdExtension = new AppAdExtension
    {
        // 'App Platform' column header in the Bulk file
        AppPlatform = "Windows",
        // 'App Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AppStoreId = "AppStoreIdGoesHere",
        // 'Destination Url' column header in the Bulk file
        DestinationUrl = "DestinationUrlGoesHere",
        // 'Device Preference' column header in the Bulk file
        DevicePreference = null,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        DisplayText = "Contoso",
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = appAdExtensionIdKey,
        // 'Ad Schedule' column header in the Bulk file
        Scheduling = new Schedule
        {
            // Each day and time range is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            DayTimeRanges = new[]
            {
                // Within each day and time range the format is Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute].
                new DayTime
                {
                    Day = Day.Monday,
                    StartHour = 9,
                    StartMinute = Minute.Zero,
                    EndHour = 21,
                    EndMinute = Minute.Zero,
                },
            },
            // 'End Date' column header in the Bulk file
            EndDate = new Microsoft.BingAds.V13.CampaignManagement.Date
            {
                Month = 12,
                Day = 31,
                Year = DateTime.UtcNow.Year + 1
            },
            // 'Start Date' column header in the Bulk file
            StartDate = null,
            // 'Use Searcher Time Zone' column header in the Bulk file
            UseSearcherTimeZone = false,
        },

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdExtensionStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAppAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

For an *App Ad Extension* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Schedule](#adschedule)
- [App Id](#appid)
- [App Platform](#appplatform)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Destination Url](#destinationurl)
- [Device Preference](#devicepreference)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Start Date](#startdate)
- [Status](#status)
- [Text](#text)
- [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone)
- [Version](#version)

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, the ad extension will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar [start](#startdate) and [end](#enddate) dates.  
**Update:** Optional. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="appid"></a>App Id
The application identifier provided by the app store.

If the application is new, please expect to wait 4-7 days before the ad will be eligible to deliver.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="appplatform"></a>App Platform
The application platform.

Possible values include *iOS*, *Android*, *Windows Phone*, and *Windows*.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="destinationurl"></a>Destination Url
The URL of the app store download webpage that users are taken to when they click the app extension link.

The URL can contain dynamic text strings such as {keyword}. For a list of supported parameters, see the Available parameters section within the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).

The URL can contain a maximum of 1,024 characters. If the URL does not specify a protocol, the system uses the HTTP protocol when a user clicks the ad. If the URL specifies the HTTP protocol when you add an ad, the service will remove the http:// protocol string (the HTTP protocol string does not count against the 1,024 character limit); however, the service will not remove an HTTPS protocol string (https://) from the URL.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="devicepreference"></a>Device Preference
This field determines whether the preference is for the ad extension to be displayed on mobile devices or all devices.

Possible values are *All* and *Mobile*, which differ from values used in the campaign management service. 

The default value is *All*.

In the bulk download and upload results file, this field will never be empty. If you did not specify a device preference, the default value of *All* will be returned.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *All*.    
**Delete:** Read-only

## <a name="enddate"></a>End Date
The ad extension scheduled end date string formatted as *MM/DD/YYYY*.

The end date is inclusive. For example, if you set this field to 12/31/2020, the ad extensions will stop being shown at 11:59 PM on 12/31/2020.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify an end date, the ad extension will continue to be delivered unless you pause the associated campaigns, ad groups, or ads.  
**Update:** Optional. The end date can be shortened or extended, as long as the start date is either null or occurs before the new end date. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively removing the end date. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated.

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system-generated identifier of the ad extension.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad extension can then be referenced in the *Id* field of dependent record types such as [Ad Group App Ad Extension](ad-group-app-ad-extension.md) and [Campaign App Ad Extension](campaign-app-ad-extension.md). This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file.
