# Filter Link Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a filter link ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

A filter link ad extension pairs one header with between 3 and 10 clickable text values that tell customers more about your business. 

You can associate a filter link ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 20 filter link ad extensions. An expanded text ad will only include one filter link (one headline with 3 - 10 values) per impression. Use the [Account Filter Link Ad Extension](account-filter-link-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Filter Link Ad Extension](ad-group-filter-link-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Filter Link Ad Extension](campaign-filter-link-ad-extension.md) records to manage filter link ad extension associations.

You can download all *Filter Link Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *FilterLinkAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Filter Link Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Language,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,AdExtension Header Type,Texts,Final Url,Mobile Final Url
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,
Filter Link Ad Extension,Active,-18,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2020,English,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,Amenities,ValueOne;ValueTwo;ValueThree,https://www.contoso.com/one; https://www.contoso.com/two; https://www.contoso.com/three,https://mobile.contoso.com/one; https://mobile.contoso.com/two; https://mobile.contoso.com/three
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkFilterLinkAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkFilterLinkAdExtension
var bulkFilterLinkAdExtension = new BulkFilterLinkAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // FilterLinkAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    FilterLinkAdExtension = new FilterLinkAdExtension
    {
        // 'AdExtension Header Type' column header in the Bulk file
        AdExtensionHeaderType = AdExtensionHeaderType.Amenities,
        // 'Language' column header in the Bulk file
        Language = "English",
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = filterLinkAdExtensionIdKey,

## <a name="adextensionheadertype"></a>AdExtension Header Type
The header that is appended with a colon (:) and precedes the filter link values in the ad that is shown.

Filter link headers will be shown in the language that you specify. For example, if you want header Amenities in English you must set the [Language](#language) to English and the [AdExtension Header Type](#adextensionheadertype) to "Amenities". If you want header Ausstattung (Amenities in German) you must set the [Language](#language) to German and the [AdExtension Header Type](#adextensionheadertype) to "Amenities". 

The following filter link header types are supported: Amenities, Brands, Classes, Courses, DailyRates, DegreePrograms, Departments, Destinations, FeaturedHotels, Goods, Grades, Highlights, InsuranceCoverage, Items, Languages, Locations, Models, Neighborhoods, Prices, Rates, Ratings, SchoolDistricts, Services, ServiceCatalog, Shows, Sizes, Styles, Tools, Topics, Types, Vacations, Vehicles, What, Who, Why. 

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Required    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, the ad extension will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar [start](#startdate) and [end](#enddate) dates.  
**Update:** Optional. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only

If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced.

This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file.

**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and the account time zone will be used.  
**Update:** Optional. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *FALSE*. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated.
