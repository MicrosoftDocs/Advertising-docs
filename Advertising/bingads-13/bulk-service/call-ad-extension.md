# Call Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a call ad extension that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

You can associate a call ad extension with campaigns in the account. Each entity (campaign) can be associated with one call ad extension. Use the [Campaign Call Ad Extension](campaign-call-ad-extension.md) record to manage call ad extension associations.

You can download all *Call Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CallAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Call Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Phone Number,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Country Code,Call Only,Call Tracking Enabled,Toll Free
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,
Call Ad Extension,Active,-12,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2020,2065550100,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,US,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkCallAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCallAdExtension
var bulkCallAdExtension = new BulkCallAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // CallAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    CallAdExtension = new CallAdExtension
    {
        // 'Country Code' column header in the Bulk file
        CountryCode = "US",
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = callAdExtensionIdKey,
        // 'Call Only' column header in the Bulk file
        IsCallOnly = true,
        // 'Call Tracking Enabled' column header in the Bulk file
        IsCallTrackingEnabled = true,
        // 'Phone Number' column header in the Bulk file
        PhoneNumber = "2065550100",
        // 'Toll Free' column header in the Bulk file
        RequireTollFreeTrackingNumber = false,
                    
        // 'Ad Schedule' column header in the Bulk file
        Scheduling = new Schedule
        {
            // Each day and time range is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            DayTimeRanges = new[]
            {
                // Within each day and time range the format is Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute].
                new DayTime
                {
                    Day = Day.Monday,
                    StartHour = 9,
                    StartMinute = Minute.Zero,
                    EndHour = 21,
                    EndMinute = Minute.Zero,
                },
            },
            // 'End Date' column header in the Bulk file
            EndDate = new Microsoft.BingAds.V13.CampaignManagement.Date
            {
                Month = 12,
                Day = 31,
                Year = DateTime.UtcNow.Year + 1
            },
            // 'Start Date' column header in the Bulk file
            StartDate = null,
            // 'Use Searcher Time Zone' column header in the Bulk file
            UseSearcherTimeZone = false,
        },

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdExtensionStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCallAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

- [Call Tracking Enabled](#calltrackingenabled)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Country Code](#countrycode)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, the ad extension will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar [start](#startdate) and [end](#enddate) dates.  
**Update:** Optional. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.    
**Delete:** Read-only

The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="status"></a>Status

**Delete:** Required. The Status must be set to *Deleted*.

## <a name="tollfree"></a>Toll Free
You can either use your own phone number or use a Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number. A Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number is a unique phone number that is routed to your business phone number. With a Microsoft Advertising forwarding number, you can track all calls from your ad so that you can analyze the ad’s performance. This field determines whether a toll-free Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number should be created for call tracking. This field can only be set if *Call Tracking Enabled* field is also *TRUE*.

Prior to August 2017, clients could set this property to *TRUE* if a Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number should be created for call tracking. Since August 2017, clients can no longer create a new toll-free Microsoft Advertising forwarding phone number. If you set this value *TRUE* then the operation will succeed; however, a toll-free number will not be created and when you retrieve the call ad extension this property will be set to *FALSE*. If a toll-free forwarding number was provisioned prior to August 2017 then this property will be *TRUE* if the number is still active when you retrieve the call ad extension.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="usesearchertimezone"></a>Use Searcher Time Zone
Determines whether to use the account time zone or the time zone of the search user where the ads could be delivered.

Set this property to *TRUE* if you want the ad extensions to be shown in the search user's time zone, and otherwise set it to *FALSE*.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and the account time zone will be used.  
**Update:** Optional. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *FALSE*. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="version"></a>Version
The number of times the contents of the ad extension has been updated. The version is set to 1 when you add the extension and is incremented each time it's revised.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only    
**Delete:** Read-only
