# Campaign Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target Record - Bulk
Defines a Campaign Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

The Campaign Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target record can only be created within search campaigns that have valid dynamic search ads settings (comprised of the [Domain Language](campaign.md#domainlanguage), [Page Feed Ids](campaign.md#pagefeedids), [Source](campaign.md#source), and [Website](campaign.md#website) fields). The campaign's [Experiment Id](campaign.md#experimentid) must be set and the [Ad Group Type](ad-group.md#adgrouptype) must be set to "SearchDynamic".  

You can download all *Campaign Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CampaignNegativeDynamicSearchAdTargets* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new campaign negative dynamic search ad target if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Bid,Name,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Dynamic Ad Target Condition 1,Dynamic Ad Target Condition 2,Dynamic Ad Target Condition 3,Dynamic Ad Target Value 1,Dynamic Ad Target Value 2,Dynamic Ad Target Value 3
Format Version,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,
Campaign Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target,Active,,-114,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Bulk Campaign Dynamic Search Ad Target,,,Url,Category,PageContent,contoso.com,US/CA/SFO,flowers
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkCampaignNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCampaignNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget
var bulkCampaignNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget = new BulkCampaignNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget
{
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // NegativeCampaignCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.
    NegativeCampaignCriterion = new NegativeCampaignCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        CampaignId = campaignIdKey,
        Criterion = new Webpage
        {
            Parameter = new WebpageParameter
            {
                Conditions = new[]
                {
                    new WebpageCondition
                    {
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Value 1' column header in the Bulk file
                        Argument = "contoso.com",
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Condition 1' column header in the Bulk file
                        Operand = WebpageConditionOperand.Url
                    },
                    new WebpageCondition
                    {
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Value 2' column header in the Bulk file
                        Argument = "US/CA/SFO",
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Condition 2' column header in the Bulk file
                        Operand = WebpageConditionOperand.Category
                    },
                    new WebpageCondition
                    {
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Value 3' column header in the Bulk file
                        Argument = "flowers",
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Condition 3' column header in the Bulk file
                        Operand = WebpageConditionOperand.PageContent
                    },
                },
                // 'Name' column header in the Bulk file
                CriterionName = "Bulk Campaign Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target"
            }
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
    },
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = null,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCampaignNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
