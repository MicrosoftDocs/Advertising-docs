# Ad Group DayTime Criterion Record - Bulk
Defines an ad group day and time criterion that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

As your campaign progresses, you may find that your click-through rate and conversion rate are highest during certain times, for example, weeknights. This might be a perfect opportunity to use bid adjustments to improve your chances of displaying your ad Monday through Friday from 6:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M.. When targeting by time, you are targeting the searcher's local time zone. For example, if you increase your bid by 10% for 6:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M., that bid adjustment will be effective from 6:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. Eastern Time for searchers in New York, then be effective 6:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. Pacific Time for searchers in Seattle. Now you are showing your ads when your potential customers are online!

Each day and time criterion defines the day, from hour, from minute, to hour, and to minute requirements for the accompanying criterion bid adjustment. 

The maximum number of day and time criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is 49. You may not specify any overlapping day and time ranges, for example Monday from 3:00AM to 5:00AM and Monday 4:00AM to 6:00AM are not allowed for the same campaign or ad group. Also for a given campaign or ad group, the maximum number of day and time criterions per day that you can specify is seven. For example you can specify up to 7 day and time criterions where the *Day* is set to Monday.

If ad group level day and time criterions are specified, the campaign level day and time criterions are ignored for that ad group. In other words the ad group day and time criterions override the campaign day and time criterions, and are not applied as a union. 

> [!TIP]
> For an overview of how to use target criterions, see [Show Ads to Your Target Audience](../guides/show-ads-target-audience.md).

You can download all *Ad Group DayTime Criterion* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroupTargetCriterions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group day and time criterion if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Target,Bid Adjustment,Name,OS Names,Radius,Unit,From Hour,From Minute,To Hour,To Minute,Latitude,Longitude
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,
Ad Group DayTime Criterion,Active,,-1111,,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,Monday,20,,,,,0,0,4,0,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkAdGroupDayTimeCriterion* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAdGroupDayTimeCriterion
var bulkAdGroupDayTimeCriterion = new BulkAdGroupDayTimeCriterion
{
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    AdGroupName = null,
                    
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    CampaignName = null,

    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // BiddableAdGroupCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.

    BiddableAdGroupCriterion = new BiddableAdGroupCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
                        
        Criterion = new DayTimeCriterion
        {
            // 'Target' column header in the Bulk file
            Day = Day.Monday,

            // 'From Hour' column header in the Bulk file
            FromHour = 0,

            // 'To Hour' column header in the Bulk file
            ToHour = 4,

            // 'From Minute' column header in the Bulk file
            FromMinute = Minute.Zero,

            // 'To Minute' column header in the Bulk file
            ToMinute = Minute.Zero
        },

        CriterionBid = new BidMultiplier
        {
            // 'Bid Adjustment' column header in the Bulk file
            Multiplier = 20,
        },

        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdGroupCriterionStatus.Active,
    }
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAdGroupDayTimeCriterion);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
