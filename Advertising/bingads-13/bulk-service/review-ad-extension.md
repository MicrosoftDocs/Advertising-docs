# Review Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a review ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

You can associate a review ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 20 review ad extensions. An expanded text ad will only include one review per impression. Use the [Account Review Ad Extension](account-review-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Review Ad Extension](ad-group-review-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Review Ad Extension](campaign-review-ad-extension.md) records to manage review ad extension associations.

You can download all *Review Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ReviewAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Review Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Text,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Is Exact,Source,Url
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,
Review Ad Extension,Active,-16,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2020,Review Text,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,TRUE,Review Source Name,http://review.contoso.com
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkReviewAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkReviewAdExtension
var bulkReviewAdExtension = new BulkReviewAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // ReviewAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    ReviewAdExtension = new ReviewAdExtension
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = reviewAdExtensionIdKey,
        // 'Is Exact' column header in the Bulk file
        IsExact = true,
        // 'Source' column header in the Bulk file
        Source = "Review Source Name",
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Review Text",
        // 'Url' column header in the Bulk file
        Url = "http://review.contoso.com", 
                    
        // 'Ad Schedule' column header in the Bulk file
        Scheduling = new Schedule
        {
            // Each day and time range is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            DayTimeRanges = new[]
            {
                // Within each day and time range the format is Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute].
                new DayTime
                {
                    Day = Day.Monday,
                    StartHour = 9,
                    StartMinute = Minute.Zero,
                    EndHour = 21,
                    EndMinute = Minute.Zero,
                },
            },
            // 'End Date' column header in the Bulk file
            EndDate = new Microsoft.BingAds.V13.CampaignManagement.Date
            {
                Month = 12,
                Day = 31,
                Year = DateTime.UtcNow.Year + 1
            },
            // 'Start Date' column header in the Bulk file
            StartDate = null,
            // 'Use Searcher Time Zone' column header in the Bulk file
            UseSearcherTimeZone = false,
        },

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdExtensionStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkReviewAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

For a *Review Ad Extension* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Schedule](#adschedule)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)
- [Id](#id)
- [Is Exact](#isexact)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Source](#source)
- [Start Date](#startdate)
- [Status](#status)
- [Text](#text)
- [Url](#url)
- [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone)
- [Version](#version)

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, the ad extension will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar [start](#startdate) and [end](#enddate) dates.  
**Update:** Optional. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. The [Ad Schedule](#adschedule), [End Date](#enddate), [Start Date](#startdate), and [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone) fields depend on each other and are updated together. If you leave all of these fields empty during update, then none of them are updated. If you include values for any of these fields, then the prior values for all of these fields are removed or replaced. To remove all prior schedule settings, set each of these fields to *delete_value*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
