# Dynamic Search Ad Record - Bulk
Defines a dynamic search ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

With dynamic search ads, the headline and display URL are generated automatically based on the website domain and language that you want to target. The combination of the Path1, Path2, and Text elements make the dynamic search ad unique. Optionally you can supply a static headline using [page feeds](../guides/page-feeds.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in the following countries: Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Canada (CA), Denmark (DK), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Ireland (IE), Italy (IT), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), United Kingdom (UK), and United States (US).  

The Dynamic Search Ad record can only be created within search campaigns that have valid dynamic search ads settings (comprised of the [Domain Language](campaign.md#domainlanguage), [Page Feed Ids](campaign.md#pagefeedids), [Source](campaign.md#source), and [Website](campaign.md#website) fields). The campaign's [Experiment Id](campaign.md#experimentid) must be set and the [Ad Group Type](ad-group.md#adgrouptype) must be set to "SearchDynamic".  

> [!NOTE]
> You can no longer add, update, or retrieve campaigns that only support dynamic search ads. The campaign type of your existing campaigns has been updated from "DynamicSearchAds" to "Search". The ad groups are now considered "dynamic" ad groups, but there are no structural changes i.e., they contain the same auto targets and dynamic search ads as before.   

You can download all *Dynamic Search Ad* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *DynamicSearchAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new dynamic search ad if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,
Dynamic Search Ad,Active,,-1113,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameGoesHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Find New Customers & Increase Sales! Start Advertising on Contoso Today.,,,,,,,,,,,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,,,seattle,shoe sale
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkDynamicSearchAd* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkDynamicSearchAd
var bulkDynamicSearchAd = new BulkDynamicSearchAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameGoesHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // DynamicSearchAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    DynamicSearchAd = new DynamicSearchAd
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Path 1' column header in the Bulk file
        Path1 = "seattle",
        // 'Path 2' column header in the Bulk file
        Path2 = "shoe sale",
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales! Start Advertising on Contoso Today.",
        // 'Tracking Template' column header in the Bulk file
        TrackingUrlTemplate = null,
        // 'Custom Parameter' column header in the Bulk file
        UrlCustomParameters = new CustomParameters
        {
            // Each custom parameter is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            Parameters = new[] {
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "promoCode",
                    Value = "PROMO1"
                },
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "season",
                    Value = "summer"
                },
            }
        },
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkDynamicSearchAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Ad Group](#adgroup) field.

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the ad group and ad.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Microsoft Advertising will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.  

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 250 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad can then be referenced in the *Parent Id* field of dependent record types such as [Dynamic Search Ad Label](dynamic-search-ad-label.md#parentid). This is recommended if you are adding new ads and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).

**Add:** Read-only and Required. You must either specify an existing ad group identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new ads to a new ad group in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only

## <a name="path1"></a>Path 1
The first part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The display URL e.g. *www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your display URL. Then if you have specified a value for *Path 1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path 2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path 1*. For example if your domain is *contoso.com*, *Path 1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path 2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.

The maximum input length of the path is 15 characters. Note that for languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the path is 7 characters. 

The path can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions. Regardless of the total length of all unsubstituted countdown parameters, the final displayed countdown will always use 8 characters out of the total characters available. For more details see [Countdown Customizers](../guides/countdown-customizers.md). 

The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters.

If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="path2"></a>Path 2
The second part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The display URL e.g. *www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your dynamic search ads campaign level settings. Then if you have specified a value for *Path 1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path 2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path 1*. For example if your domain is *contoso.com*, *Path 1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path 2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.

You can only specify *Path 2* if *Path 1* is also set.

The maximum input length of the path is 15 characters. Note that for languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the path is 7 characters. 

The path can contain [IF](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56922/0) and [countdown](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56853/0-500) functions.

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for the URL specified with FinalUrls.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Microsoft Advertising help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Microsoft Advertising does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *https://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.   
**Delete:** Read-only
