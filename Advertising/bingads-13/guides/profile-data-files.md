# Profile Data
You can target customers by company, industry, or job function profiles (according to LinkedIn), so that your ads are displayed more frequently to people who will be interested in them. Each profile criterion defines a company, industry, or job function for the accompanying criterion bid adjustment. This guide serves as an overview of how to get profile data e.g., identifiers that are required to target by audience profile. For more details on how to setup profile target criteria, see [Show Ads to Your Target Audience](show-ads-target-audience.md#profilecriterion). 

You can use the [SearchCompanies](../campaign-management-service/searchcompanies.md) operation to search for profile data by [company name](#companyname), and otherwise for [industry](#industry) and [job function](#jobfunction) profile data use the [GetProfileDataFileUrl](../campaign-management-service/getprofiledatafileurl.md) operation. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note the following with respect to industry and job function data returned via the [GetProfileDataFileUrl](../campaign-management-service/getprofiledatafileurl.md) operation. 
> - New columns may be added at any time, so your implementation must ignore unknown columns.
> - The order of profile data is not guaranteed, so you should not take dependencies on any perceived column sort order or hierarchy.  
> - As a best practice you should download the file instead of opening it directly through an application such as Microsoft Excel. If you view the profile data in a text editor, be sure to use UTF-8 encoding instead of ANSI, otherwise some characters will not be displayed accurately.

## <a name="companyname"></a>Company Name Profile
You can use the [SearchCompanies](../campaign-management-service/searchcompanies.md) operation to search for profile data by company name.
