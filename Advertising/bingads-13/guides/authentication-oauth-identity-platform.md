# Authentication with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint for developers
Consider the user that you want to sign in e.g., example@contoso.com. The Bing Ads API will not accept the email address and password as plain text, rather when you call the Bing Ads API you need to set the AuthenticationToken header element that contains a user access token. 

How can you get an access token? Microsoft Advertising leverages the Microsoft identity platform for developers and the [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) protocol for Bing Ads API authentication. As an application developer you'll use the Microsoft authorization URL to prompt a Microsoft Advertising user for their consent, or to prompt yourself for consent if you are developing an application for your own accounts. Once consent is granted you can obtain an access token and act on behalf of the user via Bing Ads API. 

The [Microsoft identity platform endpoint for developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) allows work or school accounts from Azure AD and personal Microsoft accounts (MSA), such as hotmail.com, outlook.com, and msn.com.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the Microsoft identity platform endpoint (v2.0) allows you to obtain access tokens to authenticate both work and personal accounts via the Bing Ads API. To ensure that your application can support all users without friction or interruption of service, you should upgrade to the Microsoft identity platform endpoint in production.
> 
> As a developer, you can start using the Microsoft identity endpoint today, whether your Microsoft Advertising users have a personal Microsoft account (MSA) or Azure AD work or school account. Microsoft Advertising users who want to join the Azure AD work or school account pilot should contact their account manager.  

> [!NOTE]
> A developer token is also required for authentication. Customer and account identifiers are also required for most service operations. For more information, see [Get Started With the Bing Ads API](get-started.md). To authenticate a Microsoft Advertising user in sandbox, see [Get Sandbox Access](sandbox.md#access).  

> [!TIP]
> To get access and refresh tokens for your Microsoft Advertising user and make your first service call using the Bing Ads API, see the [Quick Start](get-started.md#quick-start) sample.
> 
> If you are using one of the Bing Ads SDKs the tokens will be refreshed automatically. For details about how to get access and refresh tokens using the Bing Ads SDKs, see [Authentication With the SDKs](sdk-authentication.md#oauth).  

You can complete these steps to get an OAuth access token and act on behalf of a Microsoft Advertising user. For your convenience this guide borrows from the Microsoft identity platform [OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) documentation, in particular the [Request user consent](#request-userconsent), [Request an access token](#request-accesstoken), and [Refresh the access token](#refresh-accesstoken) sections.     

1. [Register](#registerapplication) your application.

1. [Request user consent](#request-userconsent) for your application to manage their Microsoft Advertising accounts.  

1. [Request an access token](#request-accesstoken)  

1. [Use the access token](#use-accesstoken) in calls to the Bing Ads API.  

1. [Refresh the access token](#refresh-accesstoken)   

## <a name="registerapplication"></a>Register Your Application
Before your application can authenticate Microsoft Advertising users, you must register your application and get the corresponding client ID and client secret.  

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers in the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page. You can login using either a personal Microsoft Account or a Work or School Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Live SDK application IDs with the short hexadecimal format e.g., 0000000012345A67 are not supported with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint. Although [Live Connect](authentication-oauth-live-connect.md) integration (login.live.com) is no longer the recommended approach, you can still view and manage Live SDK applications at [https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/). If you don't see an existing app in the Azure portal, that's an indication that you should replace it with a new app. 

1. Select **New registration**. 
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information: 
    - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `My browserless client`. 
    - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**. 

    ![Supported account types](media/supported-account-types.png "Supported account types")  

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** during the initial app registration. This setting cannot be updated later in the portal unless you modify the [application manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest) e.g., ```"signInAudience": "AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount"```.  

1. Select **Register** to create the application. 
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You will use it as the `client_id` when [requesting access tokens](#request-accesstoken).  
1. Select the **Add a Redirect URI** link and then you should see the **Redirect URIs** page. 
   - For web applications, provide the base URL of your application. For example, http://localhost:31544 might be the URL for a web application running on your local machine. Users would use this URL to sign into a web client application.  
   - For public applications, locate the **Suggested Redirect URIs for public clients (mobile, desktop)** section. Select the **https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient** URI. 
   
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Clients running apps on services that span regions and devices such as Microsoft Azure should register a web application with client secret. You can get a refresh token on one device and refresh it on another so long as you have the same client ID and client secret. If you register a public application without a client secret, then you cannot use a refresh token across devices. A confidential token is bound to the client secret. 

1. For web applications, select **Certificates & secrets** under **Manage**. Select the **New client secret** button. Enter a value in **Description**, select any option for **Expires** and choose **Add**. Copy the client secret value before leaving the page. You will use it as the `client_secret` when [requesting access tokens](#request-accesstoken). 

## <a name="request-userconsent"></a>Request User Consent
Each user must be prompted and provide consent through a web browser control at least once for your application to manage their Microsoft Advertising accounts. 

For repeat or long term authentication, you should follow the authorization code grant flow for obtaining an access token. This is a standard OAuth 2.0 flow and is defined in detail in the [Authorization Code Grant section of the OAuth 2.0 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1). The authorization code flow begins with the client directing the user to the `/authorize` endpoint. In this request, the client indicates the permissions it needs to acquire from the user:

```https
// Line breaks for legibility only

https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&response_mode=query
&scope=openid%20offline_access%20https%3A%2F%2Fads.microsoft.com%2Fads.manage
&state=12345
```

> [!TIP]
> Click the link below to execute this request! After signing in, your browser should be redirected to `https://localhost/myapp/` with a `code` in the address bar.
> <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F&response_mode=query&scope=openid%20offline_access%20https%3A%2F%2Fads.microsoft.com%2Fads.manage&state=12345" target="_blank">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize...</a>
> 

The following table includes parameters that Bing Ads API clients should include in the request. For additional details about optional parameters see the Microsoft identity platform [OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) documentation. 

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
|`client_id`|required|The application (client) ID that the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal assigned your app.|
|`code_challenge`|recommended|Used to secure authorization code grants via Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). Required if `code_challenge_method` is included. For more information, see the [PKCE RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636). This is now recommended for all application types - native apps, SPAs, and confidential clients like web apps.|
|`code_challenge_method`|recommended|The method used to encode the `code_verifier` for the `code_challenge` parameter. Can be one of the following values:<br/><br/>- `plain` <br/>- `S256`<br/><br/>If excluded, `code_challenge` is assumed to be plaintext if `code_challenge` is included. Microsoft identity platform supports both `plain` and `S256`. For more information, see the [PKCE RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).|
|`prompt`|optional|Indicates the type of user interaction that your application requires. Supported values include the following:<br/>- `prompt=login` will force the user to enter their credentials on that request, negating single-sign on.<br/>- `prompt=none` is the opposite of "login" i.e., it will ensure that the user is not presented with any interactive prompt whatsoever. If the request can't be completed silently via single-sign on, the Microsoft identity platform endpoint will return an interaction_required error.<br/>- `prompt=consent` will trigger the OAuth consent dialog after the user signs in, asking the user to grant permissions to the app.<br/>- `prompt=select_account` will interrupt single sign-on and provide the account selection experience, listing all the accounts in session or any remembered account or an option to choose to use a different account altogether.|
|`redirect_uri`|required|The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app. It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the portal, except it must be url encoded. For native & mobile apps, you should use the default value of `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`.|
|`response_mode`|recommended|Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app. Can be one of the following:<br/><br/>- `query`<br/>- `fragment`<br/>- `form_post`<br/><br/>`query` provides the code as a query string parameter on your redirect URI. If you're requesting an ID token using the implicit flow, you cannot use `query` as specified in the [OpenID spec](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-multiple-response-types-1_0.html#Combinations). If you're requesting just the code, you can use `query`, `fragment`, or `form_post`. `form_post` executes a POST containing the code to your redirect URI. For more info, see [OpenID Connect protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code).|
|`response_type`|required|Must include `code` for the authorization code flow.|
|`scope`|required|A space-separated list of [scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) that you want the user to consent to. Be sure to include `https://ads.microsoft.com/ads.manage` to prompt the user for Microsoft Advertising access. Include `offline_access` to ensure that a refresh token is included in the response.|
|`state`|recommended|A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response. It can be a string of any content that you wish. A randomly generated unique value is typically used for [preventing cross-site request forgery attacks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12). The value can also encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on.|
|`tenant`|required|The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application. To ensure that your application supports both MSA personal accounts and Azure AD work or school accounts, we suggest that you use `common` as the tenant for Bing Ads API authentication.<br/><br/>In case your application requires another tenant, see [Microsoft identity platform endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints) for more information.|

At this point, the user will be asked to enter their credentials and complete the authentication. The Microsoft identity platform endpoint will also ensure that the user has consented to the permissions indicated in the `scope` query parameter. If the user has not consented to any of those permissions, it will ask the user to consent to the required permissions. Although this guide is primarily focused on managing Microsoft Advertising accounts via `scope=https://ads.microsoft.com/ads.manage`, more details about [permissions, consent, and multi-tenant apps are provided here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent).

Once the user authenticates and grants consent, the Microsoft identity platform endpoint will return a response to your app at the indicated `redirect_uri`, using the method specified in the `response_mode` parameter. For example the callback URI includes an authorization code as follows if the user granted permissions for your application to manage their Microsoft Advertising accounts: *http://localhost/myapp/?code=CodeGoesHere&state=12345*.

If the user granted your application permissions to manage their Microsoft Advertising accounts, you should use the code right away in the next step. The short duration of the authorization code, approximately 5 minutes, is subject to change. If the user denied your application permissions to manage their Microsoft Advertising accounts, the callback URI includes an error and error description field as follows: *http://localhost/myapp/?error=access_denied&error_description=ERROR_DESCRIPTION&state=ClientStateGoesHere*. For more details about OAuth errors, please see [Common OAuth Errors](handle-service-errors-exceptions.md#common-oauth-errors) and [Authentication and authorization error codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes). 

## <a name="request-accesstoken"></a>Request an access token

Now that you've acquired an authorization_code and have been granted permission by the user, you can redeem the `code` for an `access_token` to the desired resource. Do this by sending a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint:

```https
// Line breaks for legibility only

POST /{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fads.microsoft.com%2Fads.manage
&code=OAAABAAAAiL9Kn2Z27UubvWFPbm0gLWQJVzCTE9UkP3pSx1aXxUjq3n8b2JRLk4OxVXr...
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&grant_type=authorization_code
&client_secret=JqQX2PNo9bpM0uEihUPzyrh    // NOTE: Only applicable for web apps
```

The body of the request must include the request parameters and the Content-Type header must be set to *application/x-www-form-urlencoded*. Set the code parameter to the value of the authorization code retrieved in the previous step, and the grant type set to *authorization_code*. The *redirect_uri* must exactly match the redirect URI used to obtain the authorization code. Be sure to encode the redirect URL. If you registered a web application, include the *client_secret* parameter and set it to the value provisioned in [Register Your Application](#registerapplication).

The following table includes parameters that Bing Ads API clients should include in the request. For additional details about optional parameters see the Microsoft identity platform [OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) documentation. 

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
|`client_id`|required|The application (client) ID that the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal assigned your app.|
|`client_secret`|required for web apps|The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. It should not be used in a native app, because client_secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. It is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client_secret securely on the server side.  The client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent.|
|`code`|required|The authorization_code that you acquired as a result of [requesting user consent](#request-userconsent).|
|`code_verifier`|recommended|The same code_verifier that was used to obtain the authorization_code. Required if PKCE was used in the authorization code grant request. For more information, see the [PKCE RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).|
|`grant_type`|required|Must be `authorization_code` for the authorization code flow.|
|`redirect_uri`|required|The same redirect_uri value that was used to acquire the authorization_code.|
|`scope`|required|A space-separated list of scopes. The scopes requested in this leg must be equivalent to or a subset of the scopes included when you [requested user consent](#request-userconsent). If the scopes specified in this request span multiple resource servers, then the Microsoft identity platform endpoint will return a token for the resource specified in the first scope. For a more detailed explanation of scopes, refer to [permissions, consent, and scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent).|
|`tenant`|required|The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application. To ensure that your application supports both MSA personal accounts and Azure AD work or school accounts, we suggest that you use `common` as the tenant for Bing Ads API authentication.<br/><br/>In case your application requires another tenant, see [Microsoft identity platform endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints) for more information.|

## <a name="use-accesstoken"></a>Use the access token

Get the *access_token*, *refresh_token*, and *expires_in* values from the JSON response stream. Now that you've successfully acquired an `access_token`, you can [use](get-started.md#quick-start) the token in requests to Bing Ads APIs by including it in the AuthenticationToken header. The value of *expires_in* represents the maximum time in seconds, until the access token will expire. Before the access token expires, you should request a new access token as discussed in the next step. 

## <a name="refresh-accesstoken"></a>Refresh the access token

Access_tokens are short lived, and you must refresh them after they expire to continue accessing resources. You can do so by submitting another `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint, this time providing the `refresh_token` instead of the `code`.  Refresh tokens are valid for all permissions that your client has already received consent.    

Refresh tokens do not have specified lifetimes. Typically, the lifetimes of refresh tokens are relatively long. However, in some cases, refresh tokens expire, are revoked, or lack sufficient privileges for the desired action. Your application needs to expect and handle errors returned by the token issuance endpoint correctly. For more details about OAuth errors, please see [Common OAuth Errors](handle-service-errors-exceptions.md#common-oauth-errors) and [Authentication and authorization error codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes). 

```https
// Line breaks for legibility only

POST /{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e

&grant_type=refresh_token
&client_secret=JqQX2PNo9bpM0uEihUPzyrh      // NOTE: Only applicable for web apps
```

The body of the request must include the request parameters and the Content-Type header must be set to *application/x-www-form-urlencoded*. Set the refresh token parameter to the value of the refresh token retrieved in the previous step, and the grant type set to *refresh_token*. If you registered a web application, include the *client_secret* parameter and set it to the value provisioned in [Register Your Application](#registerapplication).

The following table includes parameters that Bing Ads API clients should include in the request. For additional details about optional parameters see the Microsoft identity platform [OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) documentation. 

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|---------------|----------------|--------------------|
|`client_id`|required|The application (client) ID that the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal assigned your app.|
|`client_secret`|required for web apps|The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. It should not be used in a native  app, because client_secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. It is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client_secret securely on the server side.|
|`grant_type`|required|Must be set to `refresh_token` for this leg of the authorization code flow.|
|`refresh_token`|required|The refresh_token that you acquired when you [requested an access token](#request-accesstoken).|
|`scope`|required|A space-separated list of scopes. The scopes requested in this leg must be equivalent to or a subset of the scopes included when you [requested user consent](#request-userconsent). If the scopes specified in this request span multiple resource servers, then the Microsoft identity platform endpoint will return a token for the resource specified in the first scope. For a more detailed explanation of scopes, refer to [permissions, consent, and scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent).|
|`tenant`|required|The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application. To ensure that your application supports both MSA personal accounts and Azure AD work or school accounts, we suggest that you use `common` as the tenant for Bing Ads API authentication.<br/><br/>In case your application requires another tenant, see [Microsoft identity platform endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints) for more information.|

Although refresh tokens are not revoked when used to acquire new access tokens, you are expected to discard the old refresh token. The [OAuth 2.0 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6) says: "The authorization server MAY issue a new refresh token, in which case the client MUST discard the old refresh token and replace it with the new refresh token. The authorization server MAY revoke the old refresh token after issuing a new refresh token to the client."  

Refresh tokens are, and always will be, completely opaque to your application. They are long-lived e.g., 90 days for public clients, but the app should not be written to expect that a refresh token will last for any period of time. Refresh tokens can be invalidated at any moment, and the only way for an app to know if a refresh token is valid is to attempt to redeem it by making a token request. Even if you continuously refresh the token on the same device with the most recent refresh token, you should expect to start again and [request user consent](#request-userconsent) if for example, the Microsoft Advertising user changed their password, removed a device from their list of trusted devices, or removed permissions for your application to authenticate on their behalf. At any time without prior warning Microsoft may determine that user consent should again be granted. In that case, the authorization service would return an invalid grant error as shown in the following example.

```json
{"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"The user could not be authenticated or the grant is expired. The user must first sign in and if needed grant the client application access to the requested scope."}
```

Please keep in mind that public refresh tokens are only bound to the granted device. For example if you registered a Native app and use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient` as the redirect URI, we only guarantee that it can be refreshed on the same device. Clients running apps on services that span regions and devices such as Microsoft Azure should register a Web app with client secret. The redirect URI can be localhost but cannot be `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`. If you use `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient` with a client secret the following error would be returned.

```json
{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"Public clients can't send a client secret."} Likewise for Web apps please note that refresh tokens can be invalidated at any moment.
```

You will encounter the same error if you try to request new access and refresh tokens using a refresh token that was provisioned without a client secret. For more details about OAuth errors, please see [Common OAuth Errors](handle-service-errors-exceptions.md#common-oauth-errors) and [Authentication and authorization error codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes).
