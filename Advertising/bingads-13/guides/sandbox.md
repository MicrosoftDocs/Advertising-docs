# Microsoft Advertising Sandbox

Microsoft Advertising provides an API sandbox environment where you can test your application before deploying it to the production environment. Ads that you create in sandbox are not served. Supported services in sandbox vary from production. To get the web service addresses for supported services, see [Bing Ads API Web Service Addresses](web-service-addresses.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Sandbox may be down for maintenance, with or without prior notification.  

## <a name="initial-sign-up"></a>Initial Customer Sign Up

The [sandbox and production environments](web-service-addresses.md) use separate credentials.  

Follow these steps to get a new sandbox customer. If you already have a sandbox customer and want to add a new user e.g., with Microsoft account credentials, you can skip to the [user invitation](#invite-user) steps.

1. Open a browser and navigate to [sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com](https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/)
2. Click **Sign up for Microsoft Advertising** or **Sign up now**
3. Select **Create a new email address** to create an MSA. Do not use an existing email address. 
4. Click **Next**
5. Enter an MSA email address. The email server must be outlook**-int**.com (for example, someone@outlook-int.com). 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Sandbox supports MSAs created using an outlook**-int**.com email account only. You may not use an outlook.com email account. Also, you may not use an email account from another email service (for example, @contoso.com) even if the account is linked to an outlook.com or outlook**-int**.com email account. 

6. Finish the MSA work flow by specifying the rest of your user and security information. You will then be redirected to Microsoft Advertising to continue the sandbox customer and account sign up. 
7. Fill out the **Create Account** form
8. For **Import/Create Campaign**, click **Skip campaign creation**
9. For **Go Live**, click **Skip payment information**

## <a name="invite-user"></a>Invite More Users

To [authenticate with OAuth](authentication-oauth-quick-start.md) in sandbox, you need a sandbox Microsoft account (MSA). If your sandbox customer does not yet have user credentials via a Microsoft account, you need to invite a user to work on your [sandbox](https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/) account via the following steps.

1. In Microsoft Advertising [sandbox](https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/), click your user name (upper right corner)
2. Click **Accounts & Billing**
3. Click **Users**
4. Click **Invite user**
5. Enter the email address of the user to invite. The email server must be outlook.com (for example, someone@outlook.com). 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You may send invites to outlook.com email accounts only. You may not send invites to any other domain, even if the account is linked to an outlook.com email account. If you try to send an invite to another domain (for example, someone@contoso.com), the BingAds UI will show the invite as pending indefinitely (the invite is never sent).

6. Click **Send**

Microsoft Advertising sends an email invite to the user. If the invite doesn’t show up in the inbox, check the Junk Email folder. It may take a couple of minutes to receive the invite. The following steps show how to accept the invitation.

1. Open the email from Microsoft Advertising with subject line, Invitation to Microsoft Advertising
2. Click the embedded link
3. Select **Create a new email address** to create an MSA. Do not use an existing email address. 
4. Click **Next**
5. Enter an MSA email address. The email server must be outlook**-int**.com (for example, someone@outlook-int.com). 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Sandbox supports MSAs created using an outlook**-int**.com email account only. You may not use an outlook.com email account. Also, you may not use an email account from another email service (for example, @contoso.com) even if the account is linked to an outlook.com or outlook**-int**.com email account. 

6. Finish the work flow by specifying the rest of your user information
7. Exit Microsoft Advertising after completing the MSA process.

> [!NOTE]
> The MSA signup process returns you to the SI Microsoft Advertising user interface (ui.si.bingads.microsoft.com). After completing the MSA process, sign out of the SI interface and then sign in using your new outlook**-int**.com email address at [https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/](https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/).

## <a name="access"></a>Get API Access

The [sandbox and production environments](web-service-addresses.md) use separate credentials.  

For the sandbox environment, substitute ```https://login.microsoftonline.com/common``` with ```https://login.windows-ppe.net/consumers```.  

This table includes additional sandbox endpoints.

|Description|Production|Sandbox|
|---|---|---|
|Endpoint for OAuth requests|login.microsoftonline.com|login.windows-ppe.net|
|Domain for email used when getting a Microsoft account|Any email address|outlook-int.com|
|Endpoint to change the Microsoft account password|[account.live.com/password/change](https://account.live.com/password/change)|[account.live-int.com/password/change](https://account.live-int.com/password/change)|

Although in production you must use your own developer token, all Microsoft Advertising customers can use the following universal developer token in sandbox.  

```string
BBD37VB98
```

Although in production you must use your own application ID (a.k.a. client ID), all Microsoft Advertising customers can use the following public application ID in sandbox. The "Tutorial Sample App" client ID is limited to desktop or console applications, and cannot be used with any client secret in a web application.  

```string
4c0b021c-00c3-4508-838f-d3127e8167ff
```

Now you can get access and refresh tokens for your Microsoft Advertising user and make your first service call using the Bing Ads API, see the [Quick Start](authentication-oauth-quick-start.md) guide.

> [!TIP]
> For details about how to get access and refresh tokens using the Bing Ads SDKs, see [Authentication With the SDKs](sdk-authentication.md#oauth).  

## <a name="bestpractices"></a>Sandbox Best Practices

Sandbox should not be used in the same capacity as production.

- Make sure that when you deploy your application to the production environment, you use the production WSDLs and your production credentials. 
- Sandbox contains the current production release, and will be updated with feature previews with or without prior notification. 
- Capacity of the sandbox is less than that of production, and you should not use it to perform stress or capacity testing. 
- Please do not use more than one thread.  

## <a name="adinsight"></a>Ad Insight Service
Sandbox supports a limited set of keywords for testing Ad Insight service operations. You should not use the test data to infer or expect similar estimates for your keywords in production. Some of the limitations are described in the following table. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the Ad Insight service in production instead of sandbox. Sandbox only offers a subset of production service operations, and the insight data lags behind production. Sandbox opportunity data is refreshed and updated each weekend, and is available by Monday. The keyword idea data in sandbox may lag behind production by several months. If an operation fails due to an invalid date range, try submitting the request again with an earlier date range.

## <a name="bulk"></a>Bulk Service

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign Management Service

### <a name="editorialsupport"></a>Editorial Support
Sandbox supports limited editorial reviews and appeals. You cannot get the reasons for editorial issues in sandbox as you could in production, for example via the [GetEditorialReasonsByIds](../campaign-management-service/geteditorialreasonsbyids.md) service operation.

### <a name="productads"></a>Product Ads
Product ads are supported in sandbox in the United States. To be auto-approved you must create a catalog and a Microsoft Merchant Center store that ends with "sandbox" as follows.

1. In the Microsoft Advertising web application click on **Tools**.

2. Under **Management Tools**, click on **Microsoft Merchant Center**.

3. Click **Create store**, and enter a store name that ends with "**sandbox**" (case-insensitive).

4. Add your store info, select **Product Ads** under **Catalog settings**, and click **Finish**.

5. In your new store, click **Catalog management**, and then click **Create catalog**.

6. Add your catalog name, select **Manually upload file later** under **Catalog feed file**, and click **Save**.

## <a name="billing"></a>Customer Billing Service
Payment methods are not supported in sandbox. 

## <a name="reporting"></a>Reporting Service
When you create a keyword, test performance data should be generated within a few hours. The data is provided to test generating, retrieving, and parsing reports in the sandbox. You should not use the test data to infer or expect similar performance for your keywords in production. 

Test data is generated only for the same day when the entity was added or updated. For example if you add a keyword today and download a keyword performance report for last week, there won’t be any data. You would have to pull a report that includes today in the report time period.

The following reports can return performance data in sandbox. All other report types can be submitted successfully, although the sandbox service will not return any example data i.e., the report download URL will be not be set when you poll for results.

- [AccountPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/accountperformancereportrequest.md)  
- [AdDynamicTextPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/addynamictextperformancereportrequest.md)
