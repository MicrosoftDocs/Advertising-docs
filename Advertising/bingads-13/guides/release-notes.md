- [Dynamic search ads](#dynamic-search-ads-may2021)  

### <a name="dynamic-search-ads-may2021"></a>Dynamic search ads

You can no longer add new campaigns with the DynamicSearchAds campaign type. The campaign type is being updated from "DynamicSearchAds" to "Search" during May and June. You can still view and edit these campaigns before and after the campaign type update.

## <a name="april2021"></a>April 2021

See below for Bing Ads API updates during this calendar month.  

- [Portfolio bid strategy](#portfolio-bid-strategy-april2021)  
- [Target impression share](#target-impression-share-april2021)  

### <a name="portfolio-bid-strategy-april2021"></a>Portfolio bid strategy

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

A portfolio bid strategy is an automated bidding feature that manages bidding across multiple campaigns that are all working toward the same goal.  

We automatically adjust your bids to balance under- and over-performing campaigns that share the same strategy, whether to maximize conversions, clicks, target impression share, or other performance goals. Portfolio bid strategies could be a great option for advertisers who want to make sure their entire budgets are spent efficiently.

All you have to do is choose a bid strategy type and include campaigns with complementary budgets in the portfolio. Microsoft Advertising will adjust your bids based on the performance of the entire portfolio. If your portfolio includes any campaigns with a shared budget, then you should include all of the campaigns that share the same budget.  

Portfolio bid strategies work best with one goal in mind, using complementary campaign and bid strategy types. You cannot change a portfolio's bid strategy type. If you want a campaign in the portfolio to use a different bid strategy you can move it to another portfolio. Once you choose a campaign type, the portfolio can only include campaigns of that type.  

Portfolio bid strategies are supported in the Campaign Management [BidStrategy](../campaign-management-service/bidstrategy.md) object and Bulk [Bid Strategy](../bulk-service/bid-strategy.md) record.  

### <a name="target-impression-share-april2021"></a>Target impression share

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry—it's coming soon!

Target impression share is an automated bidding strategy that you can use to get the target impression share for the ad position where you want your ads to appear.  

Target impression share is supported via the Campaign Management [BidStrategy](../campaign-management-service/bidstrategy.md), [Campaign](../campaign-management-service/campaign.md), and [TargetImpressionShareBiddingScheme](../campaign-management-service/targetimpressionsharebiddingscheme.md) objects and the Bulk [Bid Strategy](../bulk-service/bid-strategy.md) and [Campaign](../bulk-service/campaign.md) records.

### <a name="auctioninsightkpi-absolutetopofpagerate-november2020"></a>Auction Insight Absolute Top of Page Rate
Absolute top of page rate is defined as the number of times an ad is shown as the very first ad above the organic search results, divided by the total number of impressions it actually received. Ads at the absolute top of the page tend to receive more clicks.

The [AbsoluteTopOfPageRate](../ad-insight-service/auctioninsightkpi.md#absolutetopofpagerate) element is not returned by default. For more information see the [AuctionInsightKpiAdditionalField](../ad-insight-service/auctioninsightkpiadditionalfield.md#absolutetopofpagerate) value set.

### <a name="responsivead-impressiontrackingurls-november2020"></a>Impression Tracking URLs for Responsive Ads
The URLs for 1x1 impression tracking pixels. Each pixel will report Microsoft Audience Network impressions to your third-party ad reporting tool. You can include up to 2 impression tracking URLs for each responsive ad.

For each Microsoft Audience Network impression, Microsoft will ping the URL to enable impression tracking in your third party ad reporting tool. Advanced-level user tracking such as conversion tracking or tracking based on cookies or IP addresses is not supported.

Impression tracking URLs are supported in the Campaign Management [ResponsiveAd](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md) object and Bulk [Responsive Ad](../bulk-service/responsive-ad.md) record. 

When you get ads with the Campaign Management service the [ImpressionTrackingUrls](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md#impressiontrackingurls) element is not returned by default. For more information see the [AdAdditionalField](../campaign-management-service/adadditionalfield.md#impressiontrackingurls) value set. 

### <a name="flyeradextensions-november2020"></a>Flyer Ad Extensions
Flyer Extensions enable advertisers to distribute product or store catalogues (flyers) to potential customers. They can display prominently on broad queries like "weekly deals" or "weekly sales" and thus encourage shoppers to click on your ad instead of the competition’s. By their nature they help to better inform searchers, and as a result, increase user engagement e.g., click through rate.

Flyer extensions are supported in the Campaign Management [FlyerAdExtension](../campaign-management-service/flyeradextension.md) object and Bulk [Flyer Ad Extension](../bulk-service/flyer-ad-extension.md) record. 

> [!NOTE]

## <a name="january2020"></a>January 2020
See below for Bing Ads API updates during this calendar month. 

- [Deprecating Accelerated Budget Delivery](#accelerated-budget-january2020)  
- [Action Ad Extension Types](#actiontypes-january2020)  

### <a name="accelerated-budget-january2020"></a>Deprecating Accelerated Budget Delivery 
As of January 2020 the budget type for shared and unshared budgets are read-only for all DynamicSearchAds, Shopping, and Search campaigns, and any budget type value that you attempt to set will be ignored without returning an error. Previous budget settings will be migrated from accelerated to standard, and the API will only return "DailyBudgetStandard" for DynamicSearchAds, Shopping, and Search campaigns, as well as for all shared budgets. You can still use accelerated budgets with Audience campaigns. The budget type data is not migrated for Audience campaign level unshared budgets. However, the budget delivery might change as described above if the Audience campaign uses a shared budget. 

### <a name="actiontypes-january2020"></a>Action Ad Extension Types
Starting January 2020, nine action types are deprecated. For example, if you set the action type to "Browse" no error will be returned, but "LearnMore" is the effective value that will be stored and returned when retrieving the action ad extension. Your application should use the replacement values instead of the deprecated values. 

|Deprecated Action Type|Replacement Action Type| 
|-----|-----|
|Browse|LearnMore|
|Explore|LearnMore|
|Message|ContactUs|
|NewCars|ViewCars|
|SeeMore|LearnMore|
|StartFree|FreeTrial|
|UsedCars|ViewCars|
|ViewNow|LearnMore|
|VisitSite|LearnMore|

Also starting January 2020 two new action types are added i.e., RenewNow and Reorder. Please note that if you use the Campaign Management API, by default the action type returned is Unknown. (The design goal is to avoid a breaking change for clients with strict value set dependencies.) To determine the effective action type i.e., RenewNow or Reorder, include [ActionTypesPhase3](../campaign-management-service/adextensionadditionalfield.md#actiontypesphase3) when calling the [GetAdExtensionsAssociations](../campaign-management-service/getadextensionsassociations.md) and [GetAdExtensionsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadextensionsbyids.md) operations. 

One final update starting in January 2020, only the localized text for Sale and Coupon are updated to "See Sale" and "Get Coupon" respectively for all supported languages. The API value sets are unchanged for these action types. For the current localized text please see [Action Text for Action Ad Extensions](ad-languages.md#actionadextension-actiontext).

### <a name="sdk-november2019"></a>Bing Ads API SDK Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, Php, and Python SDKs are updated. For details please see release notes for Microsoft Advertising [.NET](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-dotNet-SDK/releases/tag/v13.0.1), [Java](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Java-SDK/releases/tag/v13.0.1), [Php](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-PHP-SDK/releases/tag/v0.13.0.1), and [Python](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Python-SDK/releases/tag/v13.0.1) SDK version 13.0.1. 

## <a name="october2019"></a>October 2019
See below for Bing Ads API updates during this calendar month. 

- [Include View Through Conversions](#includeviewthroughconversions-october2019)  
- [Profile Expansion Enabled](#profileexpansionenabled-october2019)  
- [Bing Ads API SDK Updates](#sdk-october2019)  

### <a name="includeviewthroughconversions-october2019"></a>Include View Through Conversions
View-through conversions are conversions that people make after they have seen your ad, even though they did not click the ad. 

If you are in the feature pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 616) this feature is enabled by default, meaning that the values in the "All" conversions columns of your performance reports will include view-through conversions. You can choose to disable it if you don't want to include view-through conversions. 

You can enable or disable the feature for each account via Bulk and Campaign Management API.
- With the Bulk API use the Account record and get or set the [Include View Through Conversions](../bulk-service/account.md#includeviewthroughconversions) field. 
- With the Campaign Management API use the [AccountProperty](../campaign-management-service/accountproperty.md) and call [GetAccountProperties](../campaign-management-service/getaccountproperties.md) or [SetAccountProperties](../campaign-management-service/setaccountproperties.md) as needed.

You can manage the view through conversion window with the Campaign Management API i.e., get or set the ViewThroughConversionWindowInMinutes property of the [DurationGoal](../campaign-management-service/durationgoal.md#viewthroughconversionwindowinminutes), [EventGoal](../campaign-management-service/eventgoal.md#viewthroughconversionwindowinminutes), [PagesViewedPerVisitGoal](../campaign-management-service/pagesviewedpervisitgoal.md#viewthroughconversionwindowinminutes), or [UrlGoal](../campaign-management-service/urlgoal.md#viewthroughconversionwindowinminutes). Be sure to explicitly request [ViewThroughConversionWindowInMinutes](../campaign-management-service/conversiongoaladditionalfield.md#viewthroughconversionwindowinminutes) as an additional field when calling [GetConversionGoalsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getconversiongoalsbyids.md#returnadditionalfields) and [GetConversionGoalsByTagIds](../campaign-management-service/getconversiongoalsbytagids.md#returnadditionalfields). 

> [!NOTE]
> View-through conversions require a [UETTag](../campaign-management-service/uettag.md), so this property is not applicable for the [AppInstallGoal](../campaign-management-service/appinstallgoal.md), [InStoreTransactionGoal](../campaign-management-service/instoretransactiongoal.md), and [OfflineConversionGoal](../campaign-management-service/offlineconversiongoal.md). 

### <a name="profileexpansionenabled-october2019"></a>Profile Expansion Enabled
Determines whether to expand LinkedIn profile targeting across your account to reach additional customers similar to the ones you currently target. 

Enabling profile targeting expansion allows Microsoft Advertising to show your ads to additional customers similar to the ones you currently target. For example, if you target a specific LinkedIn audience segment, we will also target Bing users who don't have a confirmed LinkedIn account but who share the same characteristics as LinkedIn users in that segment. 

You can enable or disable the feature for each account via Bulk and Campaign Management API.
- With the Bulk API use the Account record and get or set the [Profile Expansion Enabled](../bulk-service/account.md#profileexpansionenabled) field. 
- With the Campaign Management API use the [AccountProperty](../campaign-management-service/accountproperty.md) and call [GetAccountProperties](../campaign-management-service/getaccountproperties.md) or [SetAccountProperties](../campaign-management-service/setaccountproperties.md) as needed.

### <a name="sdk-october2019"></a>Bing Ads API SDK Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, Php, and Python SDKs are updated. For details please see release notes for Microsoft Advertising [.NET](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-dotNet-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.6), [Java](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Java-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.6), [Php](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-PHP-SDK/releases/tag/v0.12.13.6), and [Python](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Python-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.6) SDK version 12.13.6. 

## <a name="september2019"></a>September 2019
See below for Bing Ads API updates during this calendar month. 

- [Experiment Type](#experimenttype-september2019)  
- [Final Url Suffix in Reports](#finalurlsuffix-reporting-september2019)  
- [Product Negative Keyword Report](#productnegativekeyword-reporting-september2019)  
- [Bing Ads API SDK Updates](#sdk-september2019)  

### <a name="experimenttype-september2019"></a>Experiment Type
You can now set the experiment split type via the [ExperimentType](../campaign-management-service/experiment.md#experimenttype) element in the [Experiment](../campaign-management-service/experiment.md) Campaign Management object or via the [Experiment Type](../bulk-service/experiment.md#experimenttype) field in the [Experiment](../bulk-service/experiment.md) Bulk record. 

The experiment split type determines whether to show individual customers ads from the experiment and the original campaign randomly, or only from one or the other.

The possible values include TrafficBased and CookieBased. 

TrafficBased: This is also known as the search-based option. Every time customers search, they are randomly shown either ads from your experiment or ads from your original campaign. This means that individual customers could see ads from both sources if they search multiple times.

CookieBased: When individual customers search, we show ads from either your experiment or your original campaign, and use a cookie to ensure that, going forward, they will only see ads from this source. The cookie-based option has an important trade-off to consider: On one hand, you may get more accurate data, since you're ensuring that an individual customer is only responding to one source or the other. On the other hand, it may take you longer to build up statistically significant comparison data than with the search-based option.  

### <a name="finalurlsuffix-reporting-september2019"></a>Final Url Suffix in Reports
The FinalUrlSuffix column is added to the [AdPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/adperformancereportcolumn.md) value set. The FinalUrlSuffix column is also available via the [AdGroupPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/adgroupperformancereportcolumn.md), [CampaignPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/campaignperformancereportcolumn.md), [DestinationUrlPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/destinationurlperformancereportcolumn.md), and [KeywordPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportcolumn.md) value sets.

The final URL suffix is a place in your final URL where you can add parameters that will be attached to the end of your landing page URL.

### <a name="productnegativekeyword-reporting-september2019"></a>Product Negative Keyword Report
The [ProductNegativeKeywordConflictReportRequest](../reporting-service/productnegativekeywordconflictreportrequest.md) is added for Microsoft Shopping Campaigns. Use this report to confirm that negative keywords applied to your Shopping campaigns are not excessively restricting campaign performance. You can request negative keywords and the corresponding products which they're preventing from showing in your Shopping campaigns.

### <a name="sdk-september2019"></a>Bing Ads API SDK Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, Php, and Python SDKs are updated. For details please see release notes for Microsoft Advertising [.NET](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-dotNet-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.5), [Java](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Java-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.5), [Php](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-PHP-SDK/releases/tag/v0.12.13.5), and [Python](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Python-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.5) SDK version 12.13.5.

The AssociationLevel column is added to the [AudiencePerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/audienceperformancereportcolumn.md) value set. 

### <a name="sdk-august2019"></a>Bing Ads API SDK Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, Php, and Python SDKs are updated. For details please see release notes for Microsoft Advertising [.NET](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-dotNet-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.4), [Java](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Java-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.4), [Php](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-PHP-SDK/releases/tag/v0.12.13.4), and [Python](https://github.com/BingAds/BingAds-Python-SDK/releases/tag/v12.13.4) SDK version 12.13.4. 

## <a name="july2019"></a>July 2019
See below for Bing Ads API updates during this calendar month. 

- [Include in Conversions](#excludefrombidding-july2019)  
- [Base Campaign Id in Reports](#basecampaignid-reporting-july2019)  
- [Average Position in Reports](#averageposition-reporting-july2019)  
- [Audience Association ID in Reports](#associationid-reporting-july2019)  

### <a name="excludefrombidding-july2019"></a>Include in Conversions
Customers who are enabled for the Include in Conversions feature ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 574) can choose to exclude specific conversion goals from conversions report data. 

Data will be excluded from the `Conversions`, `ConversionRate`, `CostPerConversion`, `ReturnOnAdSpend`, `RevenuePerConversion`, and `Revenue` report columns for any conversion goal that has its [ExcludeFromBidding](../campaign-management-service/conversiongoal.md#excludefrombidding) property set as true. Also, if you use an automated bidding bid strategy, setting this property true will result in the goal's conversions no longer factoring into automated bidding calculations.

The `AllConversions`, `AllConversionRate`, `AllCostPerConversion`, `AllReturnOnAdSpend`, `AllRevenuePerConversion`, and `AllRevenue` columns (NEW) will include data for all conversion goals regardless of their [ExcludeFromBidding](../campaign-management-service/conversiongoal.md#excludefrombidding) setting. 

For more information, see the help article [Conversion goals: "Conversions" versus "All conversions"](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56920/-1/en/#ext:reporting).

The Microsoft identity platform endpoint allows both work or school accounts from Azure AD and personal Microsoft accounts (MSA), such as hotmail.com, outlook.com, and msn.com. The [Live Connect](authentication-oauth-live-connect.md) endpoint only allows authentication with personal accounts. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if your users do not have work or school accounts, and even if you do not use the Bing Ads API SDKs we encourage you to update the authorization URL during calendar year 2019, since the Live Connect endpoint is no longer the recommended approach for Microsoft Advertising users. For details see [Upgrade to the Microsoft identity platform endpoint FAQ](authentication-oauth.md#upgrade-identity-platform-faq) and [Authentication with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint](authentication-oauth-identity-platform.md).
