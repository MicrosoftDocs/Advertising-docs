# Ads
Microsoft Advertising provides a variety of options for ads. You can extend the ad layout to be more visually appealing and feature rich using ad extensions.

|Topic|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[Ad Extensions](ad-extensions.md)|With ad extensions, you can decorate ads with additional information that helps customers find relevant information about your products and services. For example, you can include deep links into your website to quickly direct your customers to relevant promotional or technical information that may help increase conversions.|
|[App Install Ads](app-install-ads.md)|App Install Ads are similar to expanded text ads but provide direct links to your apps with a button, sending customers directly to the applicable store to download the application. This is an ideal solution for advertisers wanting to manage and drive downloads of their apps, rather than website traffic.|
|[Audience Ads](audience-ads.md)|Audience ads are coming soon to the Microsoft Audience Network via a new responsive ad format. Audience ads are also available as an extension of search network via image ad extensions, and are targeted to user intent based on various combinations of search history, page content, and past user behavior.|
|[Countdown Customizers](countdown-customizers.md)|Countdown customizers let you easily add a countdown -- by day, hour, and then minute -- to an event in expanded text ads and responsive search ads. The countdown, which automatically updates as the event draws nearer, is eye-catching and gives potential customers greater incentive to click your ad.|
|[Dynamic Search Ads](dynamic-search-ads.md)|Dynamic search ads provide a streamlined, low-touch way to make sure customers searching on the Microsoft Advertising Network find your products or services.|
|[Editorial Review and Appeals](editorial-review-appeals.md)|Learn about the editorial review process and how to determine whether ads or keywords passed or failed the review.|
|[Expanded Text Ads](expanded-text-ads.md)|The expanded text ad format works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices so you can focus more on crafting your longer ad copy and optimizing your ad text to better engage your customers before they click your ad.|
|[Product Ads](product-ads.md)|Product ads from a Microsoft Shopping campaign include details about the product, an image, and optional promotional text. A Microsoft Shopping campaign enables you to advertise the products from your Microsoft Merchant Center store product catalog.|
|[Responsive Search Ads](responsive-search-ads.md)|Responsive search ads in the Search network allow you to set between 3-15 unique ad headlines (a.k.a. "titles") and 2-4 ad descriptions within a single ad. From there, Bing will select the most relevant headline and description combination for each given query and corresponding search user. By allowing Bing AI to select the most relevant headloine and description for each query, we ensure that the right message lands for each of your potential customers, at the right time, across all possible intent signals.|
