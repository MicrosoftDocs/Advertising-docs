# Authentication with OAuth

[!INCLUDE[request-header](./includes/mfa-required.md)]

Consider the user that you want to sign in e.g., example@contoso.com. The Bing Ads API will not accept that email address and password. Instead you need to set the AuthenticationToken header element that contains a user access token. You can think of an access token as representing a user name and password.

How can you get an access token for a user? As an application developer you'll use a Microsoft authorization URL to prompt the Microsoft Advertising user for consent. Once a user provides consent, you can get an access token and act on behalf of the user.  

Microsoft Advertising leverages the [Microsoft identity platform endpoint for developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) and the [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) protocol to authenticate work or school accounts from Azure Active Directory (AAD) and personal Microsoft accounts (MSA), such as hotmail.com, outlook.com, and msn.com.
