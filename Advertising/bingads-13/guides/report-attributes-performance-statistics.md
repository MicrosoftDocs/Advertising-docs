# Report Attributes and Performance Statistics
Each of the [Report Types](report-types.md) contains a subset of attributes and performance statistics. When submitting a report request, you must include [Attributes](#attributes) and [Performance Statistics](#performancestatistics) columns. The downloaded report will then include renamed columns (fields) corresponding to each column that you included in the report request. For information about required and optional columns, see the corresponding report column value set within [Reporting Value Sets](../reporting-service/reporting-value-sets.md). For example to determine which columns are required and optional for a [KeywordPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportrequest.md), see [KeywordPerformanceReportColumn Value Set](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportcolumn.md).

For example, if your phrase match keywords are "stereo plug," you might also choose "stereo plug" as an exact match negative keyword text to match only with this phrase. In this scenario, customers that are searching for specific items like "3.5mm stereo plug" or "gold stereo plug" would see ads for the "stereo plug" phrase match keyword, but customers searching for "stereo plug" would not see ads for the exact match keyword.<br/><br/>The possible values are *Possibly intentional conflict* and *True conflict*.<br/><br/>*Possibly intentional conflict* - The text of the keyword, after normalization (e.g. punctuation, capitalization removed), and the negative keyword are identical, and the match type of the negative keyword is more restrictive than the match type of the keyword (e.g. Keyword is phrase match, negative keyword is exact match).<br/><br/>*True conflict* - Any other negative keyword conflict.<br/><br/>If you are an advertiser who intentionally blocks a portion of match type traffic, you can use this column to filter out intentional negative keyword conflicts. If you're not, you should investigate and fix both types of conflicts.|This attribute is available only with the [NegativeKeywordConflictReportColumn value set](../reporting-service/negativekeywordconflictreportcolumn.md).|

Ads that are relevant to searchers' queries or other input are more likely to have a higher click-through rate.
