# Campaigns
The Bing Ads API provides access to all of your campaign settings, including ads, keywords, ad extensions, and targets. For an introduction to the account and campaign hierarchy within a customer, see [Entity Limits](entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

|Topic|Description|
|---------|---------------|
|[Ad Customizer Feeds](ad-customizer-feeds.md)|With ad customizers, your ads can dynamically update themselves to appeal to specific customers. All it takes is uploading an ad customizer feed that tells us what information you want to insert into your ads under which circumstances.|
|[Budget and Bid Opportunities](budget-bid-opportunities.md)|Get suggestions for new keywords, estimated bids by ad result position, estimated position by bid, and historical marketplace performance for potential new keywords.|
|[Budget and Bid Strategies](budget-bid-strategies.md)|Before your ads can run, you need to set your campaign's budget. You'll also need to choose a bid strategy type, and optionally set keyword level match type bids. |
|[Bulk Download and Upload](bulk-download-upload.md)|Download and upload campaign data in bulk asynchronously in the background.|
|[Labels](labels.md)|Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on whatever is important to you. You can then filter and run reports on your labels to get the data that is most meaningful to you.|
|[Mixed Campaigns](mixed-campaigns.md)|A mixed campaign is a search campaign with dynamic search ads settings and multiple ad group types. Expanded text ads, responsive search ads and keywords are grouped into "SearchStandard" ad groups, while dynamic search ads and auto targets are grouped into "SearchDynamic" ad groups. Instead of creating and managing two campaigns with separate budgets, the same ad extension and audience associations, similar settings, reporting tasks and so on, you can just setup one mixed campaign.|
|[Negative Keywords](negative-keywords.md)|A negative keyword is a specific word or phrase that helps to prevent your ad from being displayed to customers who are unlikely to click your ad. You can use negative keywords to prevent your ad from being displayed if the user's search query contains one of your negative keywords.|
|[Negative Sites](negative-sites.md)|A negative site is is a website URL where you do not want your ads displayed.|
|[Page Feeds](page-feeds.md)|Page feeds allow you to easily upload all the relevant URLs for your dynamic search ads campaigns. This ensures maximum website coverage and enables the labeling and targeting of specific URLs via custom labels.|
|[Show Ads to Your Target Audience](show-ads-target-audience.md)|Target your ads to display to users of a certain age group, display on certain days of the week, or display to users in a particular geographical area.|
|[Smart Shopping Campaigns](smart-shopping-campaigns.md)|Automatically optimize your shopping campaigns to target customers who are more likely to convert at higher revenue values with smart shopping campaigns. By using a combination of traditional shopping campaigns, automated bidding and targeting, smart shopping helps you get the right ad to the right user, at the right time â€“ at scale!<br/><br/>Setting your business goals and targets provides context to automatically adjust bids and shopping ads delivery to help optimize your campaigns. This, in turn, can help increase revenue and meet return on ad spend (ROAS) targets.|
|[Universal Event Tracking](universal-event-tracking.md)|Universal event tracking (UET) tags record what customers do on your website, and then Microsoft Advertising starts collecting that data allowing you to track conversions (like purchases or leads) or target audiences using remarketing lists.|
|[URL Tracking with Upgraded URLs](url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md)|URL tracking allows you to find out how people got to your website by adding tracking parameters in Microsoft Advertising and then using a third-party tracking tool or service to analyze the data. When an ad is served, the tracking parameters are dynamically appended to your landing page URL. This landing page URL is recorded on your web server and then a third-party tracking tool, like Adobe or Google Analytics, can interpret the data.<br/><br/>If you have set up tracking in Microsoft Advertising by adding URL parameters to your destination URLs, you will be interested in Upgraded URLs. Upgraded URLs separate the landing page URL from the tracking or URL parameters so if you want to edit your URL parameters, your ad doesn't have to go through another editorial review. It also allows you to define a separate mobile landing page URL if you have a website that is optimized for smaller devices.|
