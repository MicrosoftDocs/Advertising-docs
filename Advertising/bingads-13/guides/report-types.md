# Report Types
The reporting service provides reports that you can use to track finances, measure ad performance, and adjust settings to optimize your budget or campaign. The service supports the majority of popular reports available in the Microsoft Advertising web application.

Each report type aggregates the data at a different level or with a different focus. For example, you can get the performance data broken out at the keyword level, which is the lowest level of aggregation for a search campaign; or you get the performance data rolled up to the account level, which is the highest level of aggregation. You should expect a keyword performance report to take longer to generate than an account performance report.
