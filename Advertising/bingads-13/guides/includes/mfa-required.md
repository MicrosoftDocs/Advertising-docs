> Starting March 1st, 2022 we will require multi-factor authentication for all users who sign in through a third-party application that uses the Bing Ads API, Content API, and Hotel APIs.
> 
> You must update your application to use the new ```msads.manage``` scope via the [Microsoft identity platform endpoint](../authentication-oauth-identity-platform.md). All application developers must take action to use the new scope.
