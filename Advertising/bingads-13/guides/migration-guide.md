# Migrate to Version 13
> [!NOTE]
> Bing Ads API version 12 sunset as of October 31, 2019. 

The sections below describe Bing Ads API changes from version 12 to version 13.  

## <a name="authentication"></a>Authentication for All Services
The [Microsoft identity platform endpoint](authentication-oauth-identity-platform.md) for developers is now available. The Microsoft identity platform endpoint allows both work or school accounts from Azure AD and personal Microsoft accounts (MSA), such as hotmail.com, outlook.com, and msn.com. The [Live Connect](authentication-oauth-live-connect.md) endpoint only allows authentication with personal accounts. 

Although migrating from the [Live Connect](authentication-oauth-live-connect.md) endpoint to the [Microsoft identity platform endpoint](authentication-oauth-identity-platform.md) is independent of migration from version 12 to 13, we understand that many developers would like to upgrade during the same sprint.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Live Connect endpoint is no longer the recommended approach for Microsoft Advertising users. Please upgrade to the [Microsoft identity platform endpoint](authentication-oauth-identity-platform.md) to ensure that your application can support all users without friction or interruption of service. Only the Microsoft identity platform endpoint (v2.0) allows you to obtain access tokens to authenticate both work and personal accounts via the Bing Ads API. For details see [Upgrade to the Microsoft identity platform endpoint FAQ](authentication-oauth.md#upgrade-identity-platform-faq) and [Authentication with the Microsoft identity platform endpoint](authentication-oauth-identity-platform.md).  

## <a name="adinsight"></a>Ad Insight
For comprehensive version 13 service reference documentation see [Ad Insight](../ad-insight-service/ad-insight-service-reference.md).  

### <a name="adinsight-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="adinsight-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The target namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/AdInsight/v13`.

The production endpoint is [https://adinsight.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v13/AdInsightService.svc](https://adinsight.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v13/AdInsightService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://adinsight.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v13/AdInsightService.svc](https://adinsight.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v13/AdInsightService.svc).

#### <a name="adinsight-datacontractnamespace"></a>Data Contract Namespace
Previously in version 12, the data contract namespace for some entities had varied from the Ad Insight target namespace. If you used any of the following version 12 namespaces, you must insteaed use `https://bingads.microsoft.com/AdInsight/v13` in version 13.
- Microsoft.BingAds.Advertiser.AdInsight.Api.DataContract.V12.Entity.SearchParameters
- Microsoft.BingAds.Advertiser.AdInsight.Api.DataContract.V12.Entity.Common
- Microsoft.BingAds.Advertiser.AdInsight.Api.DataContract.V12.Entity.Criterions
- Microsoft.BingAds.Advertiser.AdInsight.Api.DataContract.V12.Entity

Clients who encode the SOAP envelope e.g. PHP clients who encode a `SoapVar` for [DateRangeSearchParameter](../ad-insight-service/daterangesearchparameter.md), you'll need to update to the Ad Insight Version 13 target namespace i.e., `https://bingads.microsoft.com/AdInsight/v13`.

Bing Ads Python SDK clients will need to update several namespace prefixes for the [SUDS](get-started-python.md#suds) client factory objects e.g., if you used *ns4:DateRangeSearchParameter* in Bing Ads API Version 12 you'll use *DateRangeSearchParameter* (without the 'ns4' prefix) in version 13. See [Using SUDS](get-started-python.md#suds) for details about how to determine the namespace prefix.

## <a name="bulk"></a>Bulk
For comprehensive version 13 service reference documentation see [Bulk](../bulk-service/bulk-service-reference.md).  

### <a name="bulk-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="bulk-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The target namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/CampaignManagement/v13`.

The production endpoint is [https://bulk.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/BulkService.svc](https://bulk.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/BulkService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://bulk.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/BulkService.svc](https://bulk.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/BulkService.svc).  

#### <a name="bulk-responsivead-imageassets"></a>Responsive Ad Image Assets
The Landscape Image Media Id, Landscape Logo Media Id, Square Image Media Id, and Square Logo Media Id columns are deprecated from the [Responsive Ad](../bulk-service/responsive-ad.md) record. They will still be visible in the download file, although since they will be removed in a future version you should not take any dependencies on these columns. Please use the [Images](../bulk-service/responsive-ad.md#images) column instead. 

#### <a name="bulk-entityperformancedata"></a>Entity Performance Data
Bulk download of performance data was previously sunset in version 12. Now in version 13 the EntityPerformanceData value of the [DataScope](../bulk-service/datascope.md) value set is removed from the service contract. Also the *Date* and *PerformanceStatsDateRange* objects and *ReportTimePeriod* value set are removed If you want data aggregated by day, week, or month, you can use the Reporting API. For more details see [Reports](reports.md).  

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign Management
For comprehensive version 13 service reference documentation see [Campaign Management](../campaign-management-service/campaign-management-service-reference.md).  

### <a name="campaign-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="campaign-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The target namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/CampaignManagement/v13`.

The production endpoint is [https://campaign.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/CampaignManagementService.svc](https://campaign.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/CampaignManagementService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://campaign.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/CampaignManagementService.svc](https://campaign.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v13/CampaignManagementService.svc).

#### <a name="campaign-responsivead-imageassets"></a>Responsive Ad Image Assets
The LandscapeImageMediaId, LandscapeLogoMediaId, SquareImageMediaId, and SquareLogoMediaId elements are removed from the [ResponsiveAd](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md) object. You must use the [Images](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md#images) element instead. 

#### <a name="campaign-responsivead-textassets"></a>Responsive Ad Text Assets
If you used the *LongHeadline* string element in version 12 you should use the [LongHeadlineString](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md#longheadlinestring) (string) element in version 13. The data type of [LongHeadline](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md#longheadline) is updated from string to [AssetLink](../campaign-management-service/assetlink.md). This asset link is reserved for future use. 

The [Headlines](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md#headlines) and [Descriptions](../campaign-management-service/responsivead.md#descriptions) asset link lists are added for future use.  

#### <a name="campaign-getmediametadatabyaccountid"></a>Default Paging for GetMediaMetaDataByAccountId
If the [PageInfo](../campaign-management-service/getmediametadatabyaccountid.md#pageinfo) element is not set when you call the [GetMediaMetaDataByAccountId](../campaign-management-service/getmediametadatabyaccountid.md) operation, the defaut page Index will be 0 and the default Size will be 1,000. In version 12 if PageInfo was not set, all media meta data in the account would be returned. 

#### <a name="campaign-criterion-bid-ignored"></a>Criterion Bid Ignored for Invalid Data Type
For both version 12 and 13 when adding and updating a [BiddableCampaignCriterion](../campaign-management-service/biddablecampaigncriterion.md), the derived [CriterionBid](../campaign-management-service/criterionbid.md) object type requirements vary depending upon the context of the derived [Criterion](../campaign-management-service/criterion.md) object type that it is paired with. For example, if the inherited [Criterion](../campaign-management-service/biddablecampaigncriterion.md#criterion) is a [ProductScope](../campaign-management-service/productscope.md) criterion, then you should use a [FixedBid](../campaign-management-service/fixedbid.md) object (not a [BidMultiplier](../campaign-management-service/bidmultiplier.md)). 

In version 13 if you do not use the correct [Criterion](../campaign-management-service/criterion.md) object, then your requested bid will be ignored: If the bid is required, the operation will fail; If the bid is optional, the default bid will be used.

In version 12 if you do not use the correct [Criterion](../campaign-management-service/criterion.md) object, then your requested bid would have been honored; however, when you retrieve the object later the correct type is returned. In other words the data type that you set is not the same as the data type retrieved. 

This change from version 12 to version 13 only applies to campaign level biddable criterions. For both version 12 and 13 biddable ad group criterions, if you do not use the correct [Criterion](../campaign-management-service/criterion.md) object, then your requested bid will be ignored: If the bid is required, the operation will fail; If the bid is optional, the default bid will be used.

#### <a name="campaign-keyword-bid"></a>Optional Keyword Bid
When you call the [AddKeywords](../campaign-management-service/addkeywords.md) operation, the [Bid](../campaign-management-service/keyword.md#bid) element of the [Keyword](../campaign-management-service/keyword.md) is optional. Previously in version 12, the bid was required to add keywords. If you want to inherit the default ad group bid for the keyword and match type, then you can leave the keyword bid empty.  

#### <a name="campaign-negativekeyword-matchtype"></a>Negative Keyword Match Type
The [MatchType](../campaign-management-service/negativekeyword.md#matchtype) element of the [NegativeKeyword](../campaign-management-service/negativekeyword.md) is nillable. If you had previously taken a dependency on the default [MatchType](../campaign-management-service/matchtype.md) value in version 12 i.e., Exact, then you must explicitly set this required element in version 13. 

#### <a name="campaign-dynamicsearchads-source"></a>Dynamic Search Ads Source
The *Source* element of the [DynamicSearchAdsSetting](../campaign-management-service/dynamicsearchadssetting.md) is nillable. The *IncludeDynamicSearchAdsSource* element is removed from the [AddCampaigns](../campaign-management-service/addcampaigns.md) and [UpdateCampaigns](../campaign-management-service/updatecampaigns.md) request messages. If you are enabled for page feeds, then in version 13 you can set the Source. 

#### <a name="campaign-description"></a>Campaign Description
The *Description* element is removed from the [Campaign](../campaign-management-service/campaign.md) object. You can still use the [Name](../campaign-management-service/campaign.md) element to provide a unique campaign name. 

#### <a name="campaign-returnadditionalfields"></a>Return Additional Fields
The *ReturnAdditionalFields* element is removed from the [GetAdExtensionsAssociations](../campaign-management-service/getadextensionsassociations.md), [GetAdExtensionsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadextensionsbyids.md), [GetAdGroupCriterionsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupcriterionsbyids.md),  [GetAdGroupsByCampaignId](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupsbycampaignid.md), [GetAdGroupsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupsbyids.md), [GetAdsByAdGroupId](../campaign-management-service/getadsbyadgroupid.md), [GetAdsByEditorialStatus](../campaign-management-service/getadsbyeditorialstatus.md), [GetAdsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadsbyids.md), [GetCampaignsByAccountId](../campaign-management-service/getcampaignsbyaccountid.md), [GetCampaignsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getcampaignsbyids.md), [GetKeywordsByAdGroupId](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyadgroupid.md), [GetKeywordsByEditorialStatus](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyeditorialstatus.md), and [GetKeywordsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyids.md) request messages. All elements of each ad, ad extension, ad group, biddable ad group criterion, campaign, and keyword are returned by default. 

In parallel the related AdAdditionalField, AdExtensionAdditionalField, AdGroupAdditionalField, AdGroupCriterionAdditionalField, CampaignAdditionalField, and KeywordAdditionalField value sets are removed. 

#### <a name="campaign-ismigrated"></a>Target Migration Completed
The migration from a shared target to exclusive campaign and ad group target criteria was previously completed. The IsMigrated element is now removed from the response of the [AddAdGroupCriterions](../campaign-management-service/addadgroupcriterions.md), [UpdateAdGroupCriterions](../campaign-management-service/updateadgroupcriterions.md), [AddCampaignCriterions](../campaign-management-service/addcampaigncriterions.md), and [UpdateCampaignCriterions](../campaign-management-service/updatecampaigncriterions.md) operations.

### <a name="campaign-newfeatures"></a>New Features

#### <a name="campaign-customershare"></a>Customer Share
The CustomerShare element is added to the [Audience](../campaign-management-service/audience.md) and [UetTag](../campaign-management-service/uettag.md) objects. This element is reserved for future use.

The meaning of the data has not changed from version 12 to 13.  

#### <a name="reporting-reportlanguage"></a>French Report Headers
Support for downloading a report with headers in French is removed. Only English headers are supported in version 13. The *Language* element is removed from the [ReportRequest](../reporting-service/reportrequest.md) object, and the *ReportLanguage* value set is removed.

#### <a name="reporting-campaigntype"></a>Search Campaign Type
For Search campaigns, the data returned within the *CampaignType* column is "Search". In version 12 the value returned was "Search & content".

#### <a name="reporting-score-unavailable"></a>Dash for Unavailable Quality Score
In version 13 if the quality score was not computed the data returned will be "--" (double dash) in the AdRelevance, ExpectedCtr, HistoricalAdRelevance, HistoricalExpectedCtr, HistoricalLandingPageExperience, HistoricalQualityScore, LandingPageExperience, and QualityScore columns. In version 12 the value of "0" (zero) had been returned. These columns are available in the [AdGroupPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/adgroupperformancereportcolumn.md), [CampaignPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/campaignperformancereportcolumn.md), [KeywordPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportcolumn.md), and [ShareOfVoiceReportColumn](../reporting-service/shareofvoicereportcolumn.md) value sets.

In version 13 the data that had been split between those version 12 columns is aggregated and available via the ImpressionLostToRankAggPercent column which takes all of those factors into account when calculating the impression lost to rank percent. 

#### <a name="reporting-averagecpp-clickcalls"></a>Removed AverageCpp, ClickCalls, and ManualCalls Columns
The AverageCpp, ClickCalls, and ManualCalls columns are removed from the [AccountPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/accountperformancereportcolumn.md), [AdGroupPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/adgroupperformancereportcolumn.md) and [CampaignPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/campaignperformancereportcolumn.md) value sets. 

#### <a name="reporting-calldetailreportcolumns"></a>Removed CallStatus and CallTypeName Columns
The CallStatus and CallTypeName columns are removed from the [CallDetailReportColumn](../reporting-service/calldetailreportcolumn.md) value set. Microsoft Advertising stopped charging for manual calls to a tracked number on March 12, 2014. 

#### <a name="reporting-scope"></a>Require Account, Campaign, or Ad Group Scope
In version 13 you must scope the request to specific accounts, campaigns, or ad groups. For example you can include up to 1,000 accounts, 300 campaigns, or 300 ad groups via [AccountThroughAdGroupReportScope](../reporting-service/accountthroughadgroupreportscope.md). Previously in version 12 you could leave the report scope null for some report types, and data would be returned for all accounts that you could access.
