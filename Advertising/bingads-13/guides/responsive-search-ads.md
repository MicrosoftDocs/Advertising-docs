# Responsive Search Ads
Responsive search ads in the Search network allow you to set between 3-15 unique ad headlines (a.k.a. "titles") and 2-4 ad descriptions within a single ad. From there, Bing will select the most relevant headline and description combination for each given query and corresponding search user. By allowing Bing AI to select the most relevant headline and description for each query, we ensure that the right message lands for each of your potential customers, at the right time, across all possible intent signals. 

The responsive ads shown to users appear identical to expanded text ads i.e., up to 3 headlines (title parts via expanded text ads) and 2 descriptions (text parts via expanded text ads). However, depending on the screen size, your ad may show without the third headline or second description.

> [!NOTE]
> Responsive search ads can only be created in Search campaigns where the [AdGroupType](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchStandard". If the [AdGroupType](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md#adgrouptype) is set to "SearchDynamic", then the ad group does not support responsive search ads.

The [ResponsiveSearchAd](../campaign-management-service/responsivesearchad.md) object is derived from the [Ad](../campaign-management-service/ad.md) base class and can be managed with any of the existing ad operations e.g. [AddAds](../campaign-management-service/addads.md), [DeleteAds](../campaign-management-service/deleteads.md), [GetAdsByAdGroupId](../campaign-management-service/getadsbyadgroupid.md), and [UpdateAds](../campaign-management-service/updateads.md).
