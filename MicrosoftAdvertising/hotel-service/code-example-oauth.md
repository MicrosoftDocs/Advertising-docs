# OAuth code example

The following examples show a simple desktop implementation used to get an access and refresh token. The example does not support the recommended state query parameter.

If you use the Bing Ads .NET SDK, you should use it to get your OAuth access and refresh tokens. For information, see [Getting Started](../hotel-service/get-started.md).
