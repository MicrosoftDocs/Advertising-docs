If you create hotel ads in Bing, you must use a hotel feed file to provide Bing information about the hotels that you advertise. You must define and import your hotel feed prior to sending Bing [Transaction Messages](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md).

To provide Bing your hotel listings, create an XML document or CSV file that contains a listing of each hotel you want to advertise. A listing describes the hotel's name, address, telephone number, and geographical coordinates. For information about creating the XML document or CSV file, see the following topics.
