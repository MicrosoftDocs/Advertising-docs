# Products Resource

The Products resource lets you manage product offerings in your Microsoft Merchant Center store (MMC). For information about using the Products resources, see [Managing your Products](../shopping-content/manage-products.md). For examples that show how to add, delete, and get products, see [Code Examples](../shopping-content/code-examples.md).

## Base URI

The following is the base URI that you append the templates to.  

`https://content.api.bingads.microsoft.com/shopping/v9.1/bmc/`

You may use the above Base URI or the Tenant URL shown under **Store settings** in the Microsoft Advertising web application.

## <a name="templates"/>Templates

To create the endpoints used to manage your product offerings, append the appropriate template to the base URI.

|Template|HTTP Verb|Description|Resource
|--------|---------|-----------|--------
|`{mmcMerchantId}/products/batch`|POST|Use to perform multiple inserts (updates), gets, and deletes in a single request. The batch must not include multiple actions for the same product. For example, the request must not try to insert and delete the same product.<br/><br/>Set `{mmcMerchantId}` to the MMC store ID.|Request: [Batch](#batch)<br>Response: [Batch](#batch) 
|`{mmcMerchantId}/products/{productUniqueId}`|DELETE|Use to delete a single product offering from the store.<br/><br/>Set `{mmcMerchantId}` to the MMC store ID.<br/><br/>Set `{productUniqueId}` to the fully qualified product [ID](#productid) (for example, Online:en:US:Sku123).<br/><br/>If you inserted a product with the same ID in multiple catalogs, it's deleted from all of them.|Request: N/A<br>Response: N/A
|`{mmcMerchantId}/products/{productUniqueId}`|GET|Use to get a single product offering from the store.<br/><br/>Set `{mmcMerchantId}` to the MMC store ID.<br/><br/>Set `{productUniqueId}` to the fully qualified product [ID](#productid) (for example, Online:en:US:Sku123).<br/><br/>If you inserted a product with the same ID in multiple catalogs, the service returns only one of them, and which one is undetermined.|Request: N/A<br>Response: [Product](#product) 
|`{mmcMerchantId}/products`|GET|Use to get a list of products in the store.<br/><br/>Set `{mmcMerchantId}` to the MMC store ID.|Request: N/A<br>Response: [Products](#products)
|`{mmcMerchantId}/products`|POST|Use to insert (update) a single product offering in the store.<br/><br/>If the product doesn't exist, it's added; otherwise, the product is updated. Because updates overwrite the current offering, you must include all fields that make up the offer.<br/><br/>To insert the offer into a specific catalog, specify the [bmc-catalog-id](#bmccatalogid) query parameter; otherwise, the product is inserted into the store's default catalog.<br/><br/>Set `{mmcMerchantId}` to the MMC store ID.<br/><br/>**Note** that because Get/List and Delete requests act against the store and not a specific catalog, you should not insert a product with the same [channel](#channel), [contentLanguage](#contentlanguage), [targetCountry](#targetcountry), and [offerId](#offerid) into multiple catalogs.|Request: [Product](#product)<br>Response: [Product](#product)

## <a name="queryparameters"/> Query parameters

The endpoints may include the following query parameters.

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|<a name="alt"/>alt|Optional. Use to specify the type of content that's used in the request and response. The possible values are `json` and `xml`. The default is `json`.
|<a name="bmccatalogid"/>bmc-catalog-id|Optional. Use to specify the catalog to insert (update) product offerings into.<br/><br/>Use this parameter if your store contains multiple catalogs. If you do not specify this parameter, the product is inserted into the store's default catalog.<br/><br/>This parameter is only used to insert product offerings. This parameter is ignored for Get, List, and Delete requests because they operate across catalogs. 
|<a name="dryrun"/>dry-run|Optional. Use when debugging your application to test calls. Calls that include this parameter won't affect production data (products are not inserted or deleted); however, the response will contain any errors that the call generates.<br/><br/>Consider the following limitations when using this parameter.<ul><li>Insert operations don't return IDs.</li><li>The service doesn't generate or return secondary error messages such as data quality, editorial issues, and database-related validations.</li></ul>For more information about testing your application, see [Sandbox](../shopping-content/test-code-sandbox.md). 
|<a name="maxresults"/>max-results|Optional. Use to specify the maximum number of items to return in a List request. The maximum value that you may specify is 250. The default is 25. 
|<a name="starttoken"/>start-token|Optional. Use to page through a store's list of products. The token identifies the next page of products to return in a List request. Do not specify this parameter in the first List request. If the catalog contains more than the requested number of products (see the **max-results** query parameter), the response includes the `nextPageToken` field (see [Products](#products)), which contains the token value that you use in the next List request.

## <a name="headers"/> Headers

The following are the request and response headers.
 
|Header|Description|
|---------|---------------|
|<a name="authtoken"/>AuthenticationToken|Request header.<br/><br/>Set this header to an OAuth access token. For information about getting an access token, see [Authenticating your credentials](../shopping-content/get-started.md#authentication).

|Content-Type|Request and response header.<br/><br/>The type of content in the body of the request or response. For POSTs, if you use JSON, set this header to `application/json`. Otherwise, if you use XML, set this header to `application/xml`.
|<a name="customeraccountid"/> CustomerAccountId|Request header.<br/><br/>The account ID of any account that you manage on behalf of the customer specified in the `CustomerId` header. It doesn't matter which account you specify. Specify this header only if you manage an account on behalf of the customer.
|<a name="customerid"/> CustomerId|Request header.<br/><br/>The customer ID of the customer whose store you manage. Specify this header only if you manage the store on behalf of the customer. If you set this header, you must also set the `CustomerAccountId`  header.  
|<a name="devtoken"/> DeveloperToken|Request header.<br/><br/>The client application's developer token. Each request must include this header.
