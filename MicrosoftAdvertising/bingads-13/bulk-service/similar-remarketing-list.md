# Similar Remarketing List Record - Bulk
Defines an audience that is similar to one of your remarketing lists.

> [!NOTE]
> Bulk upload is not supported. Microsoft Advertising will automatically generate similar audiences for remarketing lists if you are a pilot participant. You cannot create or edit the similar audience for a remarketing list. Having said that, you can add and delete similar remarketing list associations and exclusions. If you delete the source remarketing list, then the similar audience will also be deleted. If a similar audience is associated with a campaign or ad group, then you cannot delete the source remarketing list.

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.

You can download all *Similar Remarketing List* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *SimilarRemarketingLists* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following is a Bulk CSV example download for similar remarketing list. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Client Id,Modified Time,Name,Scope,Audience,Supported Campaign Types,Source Id
Format Version,,,,,,6.0,,,,
Similar Remarketing List,Active,IdHere,ParentIdHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Account,Similar Remarketing List,Search;DynamicSearchAds;Shopping;Audience,SourceRemarketingListIdHere
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to download the *BulkSimilarRemarketingList* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkSimilarRemarketingList
var bulkSimilarRemarketingList = new BulkSimilarRemarketingList
{
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // SimilarRemarketingList object of the Campaign Management service.
    SimilarRemarketingList = new SimilarRemarketingList
    {
        // 'Audience Network Size' column header in the Bulk file
        AudienceNetworkSize = null,
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = similarRemarketingListIdKey,
        // 'Audience' column header in the Bulk file
        Name = "Similar Remarketing List",
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        ParentId = accountIdKey,
        // 'Scope' column header in the Bulk file
        Scope = EntityScope.Account,
        // 'Audience Search Size' column header in the Bulk file
        SearchSize = null,
        // 'Source Id' column header in the Bulk file
        SourceId = sourceRemarketingListId,
        // 'Supported Campaign Types' column header in the Bulk file
        SupportedCampaignTypes = null,
    },
                
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};
```

This property will be nil or empty if the UET tag associated with the [source](#sourceid) remarketing list has a status of Unverified or Inactive, because the remarketing list can't receive the customer information from your website that it needs to build the list.
