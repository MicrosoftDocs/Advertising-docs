# Structured Snippet Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a structured snippet ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

A structured snippet ad extension pairs one header with between 3 and 10 snippet values that tell customers more about your business.

In the following example, *Courses* is the header, and *.NET*, *Java*, *Python*, and *PHP* are examples of individual values.

You can associate a structured snippet ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 20 structured snippet ad extensions. An expanded text ad will only include one structured snippet (one headline with 3 - 10 values) per impression. Use the [Account Structured Snippet Ad Extension](account-structured-snippet-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Structured Snippet Ad Extension](ad-group-structured-snippet-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Structured Snippet Ad Extension](campaign-structured-snippet-ad-extension.md) records to manage structured snippet ad extension associations.

**Courses: .NET, Java, Python, PHP**

You can associate a structured snippet ad extension with one or more campaigns and ad groups. Each campaign or ad group can be associated with between 1 and 20 structured snippet ad extensions. A text ad will only include one structured snippet (one headline with 3 - 10 values) per impression.

You can download all *Structured Snippet Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *StructuredSnippetAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Structured Snippet Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Structured Snippet Header,Structured Snippet Values
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,
Structured Snippet Ad Extension,Active,-18,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2019,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,Brands,Windows;Xbox;Skype
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkStructuredSnippetAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkStructuredSnippetAdExtension
var bulkStructuredSnippetAdExtension = new BulkStructuredSnippetAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // StructuredSnippetAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    StructuredSnippetAdExtension = new StructuredSnippetAdExtension
    {
        // 'Header' column header in the Bulk file
        Header = "Brands",
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = structuredSnippetAdExtensionIdKey,
                    
        // 'Ad Schedule' column header in the Bulk file
        Scheduling = new Schedule
        {
            // Each day and time range is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            DayTimeRanges = new[]
            {
                // Within each day and time range the format is Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute].
                new DayTime
                {
                    Day = Day.Monday,
                    StartHour = 9,
                    StartMinute = Minute.Zero,
                    EndHour = 21,
                    EndMinute = Minute.Zero,
                },
            },
            // 'End Date' column header in the Bulk file
            EndDate = new Microsoft.BingAds.V13.CampaignManagement.Date
            {
                Month = 12,
                Day = 31,
                Year = DateTime.UtcNow.Year + 1
            },
            // 'Start Date' column header in the Bulk file
            StartDate = null,
            // 'Use Searcher Time Zone' column header in the Bulk file
            UseSearcherTimeZone = false,
        },

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdExtensionStatus.Active,
        // 'Structured Snippet Values' column header in the Bulk file
        // Each value is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
        Values = new[] { "Windows", "Xbox", "Skype" },

    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkStructuredSnippetAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

For a *Structured Snippet Ad Extension* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Schedule](#adschedule)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Start Date](#startdate)
- [Status](#status)
- [Structured Snippet Header](#structuredsnippetheader)

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, then ad extensions will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar start and end dates.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. If you do not set this field, then the existing settings will be retained. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively removing all existing day and time ranges.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only

This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and the account time zone will be used.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *FALSE*.
