# UserLocationPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [UserLocationPerformanceReportRequest](userlocationperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

## <a name="values"></a>Values

|Value|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
|<a name="accountid"></a>AccountId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an account.|

|<a name="accountnumber"></a>AccountNumber|The Microsoft Advertising assigned number of an account.|
|<a name="addistribution"></a>AdDistribution|The network where you want your ads to show.|
|<a name="adgroupid"></a>AdGroupId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an ad group.|
|<a name="adgroupname"></a>AdGroupName|The ad group name.|
|<a name="assists"></a>Assists|The number of conversions from other ads within the same account that were preceded by one or more clicks from this ad. An ad is considered to have assisted the conversion if it was clicked before the most recently clicked ad that was credited with the conversion. Additionally, the click corresponding to the assist must occur  within the conversion period of the goal.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16. The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|<a name="averageposition"></a>AveragePosition|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|<a name="bidmatchtype"></a>BidMatchType|The keyword bid match type. This can be different from the *DeliveredMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|

|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|<a name="costperassist"></a>CostPerAssist|The cost per assist. The formula for calculating the cost per assist is *(Spend / Assists)*.|
