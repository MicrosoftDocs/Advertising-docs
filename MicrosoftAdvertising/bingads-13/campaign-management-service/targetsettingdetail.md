|<a name="targetandbid"></a>TargetAndBid|Determines whether you want to use the "target and bid" option or the "bid only" target option for the criterion type group. A value of *True* corresponds to the "target and bid" option, and in this case we will only deliver ads to people who meet at least one of your criteria, while letting you make bid adjustments for specific criteria. A value of *False* corresponds to the "bid only" option, and in this case we will deliver ads to everyone who meets your other targeting criteria, while letting you make bid adjustments for specific criteria.<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** Required|**boolean**|

## <a name="remarks"></a>Remarks
If the [Campaign Type](campaign.md#campaigntype) is set to Audience, the supported values are Age, Audience, CompanyName, Gender, Industry, and JobFunction. Otherwise the only value currently supported for other campaign types e.g., Search campaigns is "Audience". In other words, the "target and bid" option for the Audience criterion type is supported with all campaign types, whereas the "target and bid" option for Age, CompanyName, Gender, Industry, and JobFunction criterion groups is only supported with the Audience campaign type. 

> [!NOTE]
> Do not confuse the Audience campaign type with the Audience criterion type group name.
