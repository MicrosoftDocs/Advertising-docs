# Release notes

For information about changes that were included with each release, see the following sections.


## April 30, 2019

The following is a documentation-only change.

- Bing Ads is now Microsoft Advertising. Our new name reflects how we're growing our advertising solutions to help you reach more customers. All references to the Bing Ads platform in the documentation were changed to Microsoft Advertising. The brand change does not affect the API at this time. For example, all endpoints remain unchanged.  


## March 8, 2019
- Removed the share of voice ([SOV](../hotel-service/reporting.md#sov)) warning about including the following dimension columns if your request also includes SOV columns. Previously, if you included these dimension columns, the report's data would include duplicate SOV data. This is no longer an issue and you may include these columns with SOV columns.  
  - AdvancedBookingWindow
  - CheckinDay
  - DateType
  - LengthOfStay
  - SiteType
  - SlotType
  - UserCountry 


## December 17, 2018

- Updated the [hotel feed schema](../hotel-feed/reference.md) to include the following [\<listing>](../hotel-feed/reference.md#listingtype) elements:  
  - \<category>
  - \<content>
  

## October 28, 2018

- Added the following [dimension columns](../hotel-service/reporting.md#dimensioncolumns) to reporting. You must not specify these dimensions if your report request includes share of voice (SOV) columns. See [Share of voice](../hotel-service/reporting.md#sov).
  - AdvancedBookingWindow
  - DateType 
  - SiteType


## August 20, 2018

- Updated [Getting sandbox credentials](../hotel-service/get-started.md#getsicredentials) to reflect the current process. Previously, when you signed up for a sandbox account, the process created legacy credentials (username and password). However, the Hotel Ads API requires using a Microsoft account (MSA) for OAuth authentication. This meant you needed to invite a user to work on your account, so you could create an MSA account to use with the Hotel Ads API. This process is no longer required since sandbox now supports only MSA&mdash;you may create a sandbox account using only an MSA and you must sign in using only an MSA.

- Updated information about how to pause hotels. Previously, the documentation said that to pause all hotels in a subaccount, you'd set the subaccount's budget or bid amount to zero (0). Or, to pause all hotels in a hotel group, you'd set the group's bid amount to zero. Same for pausing individual hotels. Instead, to pause hotels, at any level, you must specify a percentage bid and set the percentage bid amount to 0. If you currently specify a fixed bid and you want to pause hotels, you must change the bid to a percentage bid and set its bid amount to zero.

## August 7, 2018

### Nonbreaking change

- Added the following columns to the Performance report. For more information, see [Performance report columns](../hotel-service/reporting.md#performance-report-columns).  
  
  - [Dimension columns](../hotel-service/reporting.md#dimensioncolumns)  
    
    - AdvancedBookingWindow  
    - CheckinDay
    - DateType  
    - SiteType  

- Changed the UserCountry dimension to reflect the country where the user is located instead of the publisher's country. Prior to August 2, 2018, UserCountry contains the publisher's country. After August 2, 2018, UserCountry contains the userâ€™s country.

## May 3, 2018

## March 28, 2018

### Nonbreaking change

## March 21, 2018

### Nonbreaking change

## March 5, 2018

### Nonbreaking change

- Added the [IncludeNonPerformingHotels](../hotel-service/reference.md#includenonperforminghotels) field to the [ReportJob](../hotel-service/reference.md#reportjob) object. By default, performance reports don't include hotels that have no impressions during the reporting period. To include non-performing hotels in the report, set `IncludeNonPerformingHotels` to **true**. For limitations, see [Including non-performing hotels in the report](../hotel-service/reporting.md#including-non-performing-hotels-in-the-report).



## February 22, 2018

- Fixed documentation error: Removed Paused as a possible value from the `Status` field of [Hotel](../hotel-service/reference.md#hotel), [HotelGroup](../hotel-service/reference.md#hotelgroup), and [Subaccount](../hotel-service/reference.md#subaccount). 



## October 15, 2017

Released the Beta version of Hotel Ads.

### Nonbreaking changes

- Added the following ways to send Bing your transaction messages.  
  - Pull requests  
  If you sign up for pull requests, Bing sends the endpoint that you specify a [Query](../query-message/query-message.md) message that specifies the itinerary data that you should send back in a [Transaction](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md) message. With this option, you provide Bing all of your itinerary data.  
  - Pull with hints requests  
  If you sign up for pull with hints requests, Bing sends the endpoint that you specify a Query message that specifies the itinerary data that you should send back in a Transaction message. However, the query message specifies only the itinerary data that you said changed in your [Hint](../hint-message/hint-message.md) message. 
  
- Added the following messages to support the two types of pull requests.  
  - [QueryControl](../query-control-message/query-control-message.md) message  
  - [Hint](../hint-message/hint-message.md) message
  - [Query](../query-message/query-message.md) message  
  
- Increased the number of days prior to check in that users can book (advanced booking window) from 90 days to 180 days.

### Hotel API

#### Nonbreaking changes

- Added the `BidMultiplierSource` field to the [Hotel](../hotel-service/reference.md#hotel) and  [HotelGroup](../hotel-service/reference.md#hotelgroup) objects. The source field indicates whether the object inherits or defines the bid multipliers. For example, if hotel object inherits the multipliers from the subaccount, `BidMultiplierSource` is SubAccount.  
  
- Added support for the [$select](../hotel-service/reference.md#select-param) OData query parameter. You can use the parameter to select the fields that you want the response to include.
