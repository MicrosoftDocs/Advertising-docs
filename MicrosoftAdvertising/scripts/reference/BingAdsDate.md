# BingAdsDate

Contains properties that define a date.

Do not use this object to specify a date when calling one of the `forDateRange()` methods such as [AdGroupSelector.forDateRange()](AdGroupSelector.md#fordaterange-object-datefrom-object-dateto-). Instead, use this object to receive a date from methods such as [AdGroup.getStartDate()](AdGroup.md#getstartdate).

|month|integer|The numeric calendar month, where 1 is January and 12 is December.
|year|integer|The four-digit calendar year. For example, 2018.
