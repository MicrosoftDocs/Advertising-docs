# ShareOfVoiceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [ShareOfVoiceReportRequest](shareofvoicereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> The ImpressionSharePercent, ImpressionLostToBudgetPercent, and ImpressionLostToRankPercent columns are the only applicable Share of Voice data available for Microsoft Advertising Shopping Campaigns.

## <a name="values"></a>Values

|Value|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
|<a name="accountid"></a>AccountId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an account.|
|<a name="accountname"></a>AccountName|The account name.|
|<a name="accountnumber"></a>AccountNumber|The Microsoft Advertising assigned number of an account.|
|<a name="accountstatus"></a>AccountStatus|The account status.|
|<a name="addistribution"></a>AdDistribution|The network where you want your ads to show.|
|<a name="adgroupid"></a>AdGroupId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of an ad group.|
|<a name="adgroupname"></a>AdGroupName|The ad group name.|
|<a name="adgroupstatus"></a>AdGroupStatus|The ad group status.|
|<a name="adrelevance"></a>AdRelevance|How closely related your ads is to the customer's search query or other input. It tells you how relevant your ad and landing page are to potential customers. A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score. Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16. The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|<a name="averageposition"></a>AveragePosition|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|<a name="bidmatchtype"></a>BidMatchType|The keyword bid match type. This can be different from the *DeliveredMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="bidstrategytype"></a>BidStrategyType|The bid strategy type. Possible values include *EnhancedCpc*, *ManualCpc*, *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, and *TargetCpa*. If the *InheritFromParent* strategy type is used, the report will include the inherited bid strategy type e.g. one of the supported values listed above.|
|<a name="campaignid"></a>CampaignId|The Microsoft Advertising assigned identifier of a campaign.|
|<a name="campaignname"></a>CampaignName|The campaign name.|
|<a name="campaignstatus"></a>CampaignStatus|The campaign status.|
|<a name="clicks"></a>Clicks|Clicks are what you pay for. Clicks typically include a customer clicking an ad on a search results page or on a website on the search network. Clicks can also come from other sources (for example, spiders, robots, and test servers). For more information, see [Microsoft Advertising click measurement: description of methodology](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/microsoft-advertising-click-measurement-description-of-methodology).|
|<a name="clicksharepercent"></a>ClickSharePercent|The percentage of clicks that went to your ads. It is the share of the prospective customer's mindshare and buying intent you captured. You can use this performance metric to see where your growth opportunites are.<br/><br/>For example, your click share percent is 30% if 10 ads were clicked, and three of the 10 ads were yours.|
|<a name="conversionrate"></a>ConversionRate|The conversion rate as a percentage. The number of conversions, divided by the total number of clicks. For example, if the ads in your campaign got 300 clicks and four conversions, the conversion rate is 1.33 (%). The formula for calculating the conversion rate is *(Conversions / Clicks) x 100*.|
|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|<a name="costperconversion"></a>CostPerConversion|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*. Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|
|<a name="ctr"></a>Ctr|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%). The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) x 100*.|
|<a name="currentmaxcpc"></a>CurrentMaxCpc|The maximum cost per click bid that was in effect at the time the report was generated. It is not a moving historical bid throughout the report time period.|
|<a name="deliveredmatchtype"></a>DeliveredMatchType|The match type used to deliver an ad. This can be different from the *BidMatchType* column, for example if you bid on a broad match and the search term was an exact match. For more information, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). The possible values are *Broad*, *Exact*, *Phrase*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="devicetype"></a>DeviceType|The device name attribute of a device OS target bid. The type of device which showed ads. The possible values include *Computer*, *Smartphone*, *Tablet*, and *Unknown*.|
|<a name="exactmatchimpressionsharepercent"></a>ExactMatchImpressionSharePercent|The estimated percentage of impressions that your campaign received for searches that exactly matched your keyword, out of the total available exact match impressions you were eligible to receive.<br/><br/>Reports on exact match impression share highlight how your keywords perform only on those searches that exactly match your keywords. Use this data together with impression share to diagnose your non-exact match keywords, and make changes to be more competitive and gain more impressions.|
|<a name="expectedctr"></a>ExpectedCtr|How well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. Ads that are relevant to searchers' queries or other input are more likely to have a higher click-through rate. This metric tells you if a keyword is underperforming and causing a loss in impression share, so you can make keyword changes or remove ads altogether. A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score. Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
|<a name="impressionlosttoadrelevancepercent"></a>ImpressionLostToAdRelevancePercent|The percentage of impression share lost due to low ad relevance. The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. If you try to include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will return code *2053*.  For reports that include impression share performance statistics columns you should not include restricted attributes such as *DeviceOS* in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, you should exclude all of the impression share performance statistics columns. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions). Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. For Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, this data is not available.<br/><br/>This column is deprecated and will be removed in a future API version.|
|<a name="impressionlosttobidpercent"></a>ImpressionLostToBidPercent|The percentage of time your ads would have been displayed to users, but were not because your bid was too low or your bid and quality score was below minimum thresholds, which prevented you from entering the auction. The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. If you try to include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will return code *2053*.  For reports that include impression share performance statistics columns you should not include restricted attributes such as *DeviceOS* in the same report request. Likewise if you include any of the restricted attribute columns, you should exclude all of the impression share performance statistics columns. For more information, see [Column Restrictions](../guides/reports.md#columnrestrictions). Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. For Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, this data is only available with the campaign and ad group performance reports.<br/><br/>This column is deprecated and will be removed in a future API version.|
|<a name="impressionlosttobudgetpercent"></a>ImpressionLostToBudgetPercent|The estimated percentage of impressions your ad did not receive due to issues with your daily or monthly budget. The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. If you try to include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will return code *2053*.  For reports that include impression share performance statistics columns you should not include restricted attributes such as *DeviceOS* in the same report request.

For Microsoft Shopping Campaigns, this data is only available with the campaign and ad group performance reports.|
|<a name="impressionlosttoexpectedctrpercent"></a>ImpressionLostToExpectedCtrPercent|The percentage of impression share lost due to low expected click-through rate. If this is high, figure out what you can do to increase your CTR. The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. If you try to include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will return code *2053*.  For reports that include impression share performance statistics columns you should not include restricted attributes such as *DeviceOS* in the same report request.

|<a name="impressionsharepercent"></a>ImpressionSharePercent|The estimated percentage of impressions, out of the total available impressions in the market you were targeting. The value of this column is empty if the data is not available. For example, out of estimated 59,000 impressions that occurred on this day in your targeted market, you got only about 2,300, or 3%. If you try to include this column with *Hourly* or *HourOfDay* aggregation the service will return code *2053*.  For reports that include impression share performance statistics columns you should not include restricted attributes such as *DeviceOS* in the same report request.

|<a name="keywordstatus"></a>KeywordStatus|The keyword status.|
|<a name="landingpageexperience"></a>LandingPageExperience|An aggregate quality assessment of all landing pages on your site. The landing page experience score measures whether your landing page is likely to provide a good experience to customers who click your ad and land on your website.

Use this data to make the best decision on network selection for your ad groups. The possible values include AOL search, Audience, Bing and Yahoo! search, Content, and Syndicated search partners.|
|<a name="qualityscore"></a>QualityScore|The numeric score shows you how competitive your ads are in the marketplace by measuring how relevant your keywords and landing pages are to customers' search terms. The quality score is calculated by Microsoft Advertising using the *ExpectedCtr*, *AdRelevance*, and *LandingPageExperience* sub scores. If available, the quality score can range from a low of 1 to a high of 10. Quality score is based on the last rolling 30 days for the owned and operated search traffic. A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. Traffic for syndicated networks do not affect quality score. The value in the report will be "0" (zero) if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more. Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day. If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated. If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period. Use the historic quality score to find out how quality score may have changed over time. Historical quality score is a daily snapshot of the rolling quality score.  For more information on historic quality score, see the *HistoricalQualityScore* column.|
|<a name="spend"></a>Spend|The cost per click (CPC) summed for each click.|
|<a name="timeperiod"></a>TimePeriod|The time period of each report row. You may not include this column if the *Aggregation* element of the request object is set to Summary. For more information, see [Time Period Column](../guides/reports.md#timeperiod).|
