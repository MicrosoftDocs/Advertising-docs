# MaxClicksBiddingScheme Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an object that represents the maximum clicks bid strategy type.

> [!NOTE]
> The *MaxClicks* bid strategy is available only for Dynamic Search Ads and Search campaigns.

With the *MaxClicks* bid strategy, you don't need to set ad group or keyword bids. Microsoft Advertising automatically sets your bids in real time to get as many clicks as possible within your budget.

Microsoft Advertising will always respect your overall budget limit, but if you want greater control over your bids while using Maximize Clicks, you can also set a maximum CPC (cost per click). This is an optional limit you can set to make sure that Microsoft Advertising never pays more than a certain amount for each individual click.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If the campaign bid strategy type is set to *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, or *TargetCpa*, the behavior of existing features will change unless you set an individual ad group's or keyword's bid strategy to *ManualCpc*. For more details, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md). 
> - You can continue to set the ad group and keyword bids; however they will not be used by Microsoft Advertising.
> - Microsoft Advertising will periodically change your stored ad group or keyword bid settings. You can continue to set new bids, however Microsoft Advertising may change them at any time using this bid strategy type.
> - You can continue to set bid adjustments e.g. for age, gender, or location; however, the multiplier will inform rather than directly modify or override the automated bid. For auto bidding the multiplier is used as a weighted percentage to inform Microsoft Advertising about how much you value the criterion relative to other criteria. For example, a -50% bid multiplier for a mobile device criterion with the Max Conversions bid strategy to indicate that you value conversions from mobile traffic half as much as other device types. The same bid multiplier with the Max Clicks bid strategy would indicate that you value clicks on mobile half as much as other device types. The valid range of values that you can use to inform auto bidding is -100.00 through 30.00.
> - Even if the [AdRotation](adgroup.md#adrotation) is set to *RotateAdsEvenly*, it will be ignored as these bid strategies prioritize better-performing ads.
