# ProductAudience Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a product audience that you can use to remarket products from your Microsoft Merchant Center store.

Using Product Audiences, you can remarket to customers based on the specific products they viewed or added to their cart. Feed-based ads promote those same products to customers (known as dynamic remarketing).

Product audiences work best with both Shopping campaigns and feed-based Audience campaigns i.e., those campaigns that leverage a Microsoft Merchant Center [store ID](shoppingsetting.md#storeid). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to edit the script corresponding to the [UET Tag Id](#tagid) on your website to include the `ecomm_prodid` and `ecomm_pagetype` parameters.
> The ecomm_prodid parameter is the product ID of the product on the page. It is unique for each item and must match either the id or item_group_id attribute in your product feed. Numeric and alphanumeric (including hyphens) characters only, with a maximum of 50 characters. 
> The ecomm_pagetype parameter identifies the type of page the user has visited. Valid options: home, searchresults, category, product, cart, purchase, other.

```javascript
window.uetq = window.uetq || [];
window.uetq.push('event', '', {'ecomm_prodid': 'REPLACE_WITH_PRODUCT_ID', 'ecomm_pagetype': 'REPLACE_WITH_PAGE_TYPE'});
```
