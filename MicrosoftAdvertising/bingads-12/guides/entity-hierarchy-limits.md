For more information, see [Ad Extensions](ad-extensions.md).

An account can contain up to 200,000 sitelink ad extensions. Outside of that limit, each account can contain up to 150,000 ad extensions of all other types combined. 

The entity (account, campaign, or ad group) to ad extension association limit varies by ad extension type.

Each ad group can contain 20,000 keywords.

Each account can contain 5,000,000 keywords.

Each customer can contain 50,000,000 keywords.

You can manage keywords using the Bulk service ([Keyword Record](../bulk-service/keyword.md)) or Campaign Management service ([Keyword](../campaign-management-service/keyword.md)).

The following table defines limits for keyword properties.

## <a name="label"></a>Labels
Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on whatever is important to you. You can then filter and run reports on your labels to get the data that is most meaningful to you.

Each account can contain 100,000 labels.

Although not pictured above, labels can be associated with campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords. You can apply one label to multiple entities. The association count is only limited by the number of campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords in your account.

You can manage labels using the Bulk service ([Label Record](../bulk-service/label.md)) or Campaign Management service ([Label](../campaign-management-service/label.md)).


|Property|Limit|
|------------|---------|
|Description|The label description can be between 1 to 200 characters in length.|
|Name|The case-sensitive label name can be between 1 to 80 characters in length, and must be unique across all labels in the account.|

## <a name="negativekeywords"></a>Negative Keywords
To explicitly opt out of bidding for keyword match types, you can set negative keywords at the campaign and ad group level.

Each ad group or campaign can contain up to 20,000 negative keywords, and each negative keyword can contain a maximum of 100 characters.

> [!NOTE]
> The 20,000 negative keyword limit is allowed per campaign and ad group up to the account limit of 5,000,000 negative keywords. These limits are separate from the limits for negative keyword lists.

Additionally a campaign can be associated with any or all negative keyword lists within the account, and each list can contain up to 5,000 shared negative keywords. A maximum of 20 negative keyword lists are allowed per account and each list can be associated with any or all campaigns in the account. Thus one campaign could effectively have 120,000 negative keywords applied via the sum of the 20,000 negative keywords exclusively set for that campaign and the 100,000 shared negative keywords (20 lists multiplied by 5,000 negative keywords per list).

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum number associations between campaigns and negative keyword lists is 50,000 per account. For example if you have five negative keyword lists and associate all of them with each of your 10,000 campaigns, then you are not allowed to associate a sixth negative keyword list with any campaign.

If you set negative keywords at both levels, both lists will be used in comparison to the user's query. Thus an ad group could effectively have 140,000 negative keywords applied via the sum of the 20,000 negative keywords exclusively set for that ad group, the 20,000 negative keywords exclusively set for the ad group's parent campaign, and the 100,000 negative keywords in lists shared with the ad group's parent campaign.

For more information about managing negative keywords and negative keyword lists, please see the technical guide about [Negative Keywords](negative-keywords.md).

## <a name="negativesites"></a>Negative Site Placements
To prevent your ad from appearing on specific web sites within the search network you can configure website exclusions, also known as negative site placements. To explicitly opt out from having your search ads displayed on partner websites sites, you can set negative sites at the campaign and ad group level. For search ads, you can set only syndicated search websites. Ad-group-level website exclusions override campaign-level website exclusions.

You can manage negative site placements using the Campaign Management service ([AdGroupNegativeSites](../campaign-management-service/adgroupnegativesites.md)) and ([CampaignNegativeSites](../campaign-management-service/campaignnegativesites.md)).

Each ad group or campaign can contain up to 2,500 negative site placements. Each URL must specify the domain name e.g., *contoso.com* which can include up to three subdomains and two subdirectories. The subdomain count includes the *www* prefix. For example *one.two.three.contoso.com/1/2*, *www.two.three.contoso.com/1/2*, and *one.two.contoso.co.uk/1/2* are valid URLs, whereas *one.two.three.contoso.co.uk/1/2* (too many subdomains) and *one.two.three.contoso.com/1/2/3* (too many subdirectories) are not.

## <a name="productgroup"></a>Product Groups
Product groups are used to determine which products from your Microsoft Merchant Center catalog should be included in a particular ad group. In order to understand product groups, first make sure you are familiar with [Product Ads](product-ads.md).

After you create a shopping campaign, Microsoft Advertising creates a default ad group. That ad group includes a product group containing all of the products in your Microsoft Merchant Center catalog feed. However, you don't typically want an ad group to contain all products. Instead, you likely want each ad group to contain only very closely related products in order more effectively manage which ads show, and when. With product groups you can narrow down that default group to a customized list of specific products.

There is a 1 to 1 relationship between ad groups and product groups. In other words, each ad group has one product group and vice versa.

You can manage product groups using the Bulk service ([Ad Group Product Partition](../bulk-service/ad-group-product-partition.md)) or Campaign Management service ([ProductPartition](../campaign-management-service/productpartition.md)).

For more information, see the Microsoft Advertising Help article [Understand and use product groups](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50901/1).


## <a name="targets"></a>Targets
You can set criteria to show your ads based on age, day and time, device, gender, and location. Where necessary to distinguish from other criterion types the documentation may refer to these entities as *target criterions*. For more information about managing targets, see the [Show Ads to Your Target Audience](show-ads-target-audience.md) technical guide.

### <a name="agecriterions"></a>Age Criterions
The maximum number of age criterions that you can set per campaign or ad group is five, i.e. one for each of the supported age ranges *EighteenToTwentyFour*, *TwentyFiveToThirtyFour*, *ThirtyFiveToFortyNine*, *FiftyToSixtyFour*, and *SixtyFiveAndAbove*.

### <a name="companynamecriterions"></a>Company Name Criterions
The maximum number of company name profile criterions that you can apply to each campaign or ad group is 1,000.

### <a name="daytimecriterions"></a>Day and Time Criterions

Also for a given campaign or ad group, the maximum number of day and time criterions per day that you can set is seven. For example you can set up to 7 day and time criterions where the *Day* is set to Monday. 

### <a name="devicecriterions"></a>Device Criterions
The maximum number of device criterions that you can set per campaign or ad group is three. You must either have three separate criterions for *Computers*, *Smartphones*, and *Tablets*, otherwise no device criterions can exist for the campaign or ad group.

### <a name="gendercriterions"></a>Gender Criterions
The maximum number of gender criterions that you can set per campaign or ad group is two i.e. one for *Male* and one for *Female*.

### <a name="locationcriterions"></a>Location Criterions
The maximum number of combined location and negative location criterions that you can set per campaign or ad group is 10,000. For example, you can set a maximum of 10,000 city location criteria or 1,000 state location criteria and 9,000 city location criteria. 

### <a name="locationintentcriterions"></a>Location Intent Criterions
The maximum number of location intent criterions that you can set per campaign or ad group is one.

### <a name="radiuscriterions"></a>Radius Criterions

> [!NOTE] 
> Each of these limits are independent of one another e.g., the radius criterions limit stands regardless of whether or not any location criterions exist for the campaign or ad group.
