# Ad Group Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target Record - Bulk
Defines an Ad Group Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.  

You can download all *Ad Group Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroupNegativeDynamicSearchAdTargets* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group negative dynamic search ad target if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Bid,Name,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Dynamic Ad Target Condition 1,Dynamic Ad Target Condition 2,Dynamic Ad Target Condition 3,Dynamic Ad Target Value 1,Dynamic Ad Target Value 2,Dynamic Ad Target Value 3
Format Version,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,
Ad Group Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target,Paused,,-1113,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Bulk Ad Group Dynamic Search Ad Target,,,Url,Category,PageContent,contoso.com,US/CA/,flowers
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkAdGroupNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAdGroupNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget
var bulkAdGroupNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget = new BulkAdGroupNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget
{
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // NegativeAdGroupCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.
    NegativeAdGroupCriterion = new NegativeAdGroupCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
        Criterion = new Webpage
        {
            Parameter = new WebpageParameter
            {
                Conditions = new[]
                {
                    new WebpageCondition
                    {
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Value 1' column header in the Bulk file
                        Argument = "contoso.com",
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Condition 1' column header in the Bulk file
                        Operand = WebpageConditionOperand.Url
                    },
                    new WebpageCondition
                    {
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Value 2' column header in the Bulk file
                        Argument = "US/CA/",
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Condition 2' column header in the Bulk file
                        Operand = WebpageConditionOperand.Category
                    },
                    new WebpageCondition
                    {
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Value 3' column header in the Bulk file
                        Argument = "flowers",
                        // 'Dynamic Ad Target Condition 3' column header in the Bulk file
                        Operand = WebpageConditionOperand.PageContent
                    },
                },
                // 'Name' column header in the Bulk file
                CriterionName = "Bulk Ad Group Negative Dynamic Search Ad Target"
            }
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdGroupCriterionStatus.Paused,
    },
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = null,
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = null,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAdGroupNegativeDynamicSearchAdTarget);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
