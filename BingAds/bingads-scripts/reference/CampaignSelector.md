get|[CampaignIterator](./CampaignIterator)|Returns an iterator indexing the campaigns in this selector.<br />
orderBy(String orderBy)|[CampaignSelector](./CampaignSelector)|Returns a selector by specifying the condition for ordering the campaigns in this selector. The format for the condition is "columnName orderDirection", for example, "Cost DESC".<br /> <br /> &nbsp;•	columnName can only be one column which is supported by the withCondition method.<br /> &nbsp;•	orderDirection can be either ASC for ascending or DESC for descending. If no order direction is specified, ASC is used by default.<br /> <br /> <code>orderBy()</code> can be invoked multiple times by calling it in sequence as shown by the following example:<br /> <br /> <code> campaignSelector = campaignSelector.orderBy("MaxCpc") &nbsp;&nbsp;.orderBy("Clicks ASC"); </code><br />
withCondition(String condition)|[CampaignSelector](./CampaignSelector)|Returns a selector by specifying the filtering condition on the campaigns in this selector. The format for the condition string is "columnName operator value", for e.g., "AverageCpm > 0.35", where:<br /> <br /> &nbsp;•	columnName must be from the list of supported columns for campaigns (see table below).<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;o	If a Stats column is used in withCondition, it must be preceded by a forDateRange() invocation in the call chain.<br /> &nbsp;•	operator must be from the list of standard operators supported by Bing Ads Scripts.<br /> &nbsp;•	value is a value that falls within the accepted range of values for the data type of the column represented by columnName.<br /> <br /> As with the <code>orderBy()</code> method, <code>withCondition()</code> can also be used multiple times.<br />
withIds(long[] ids)|[CampaignSelector](./CampaignSelector)|Returns a selector by specifying the list of IDs to filter campaigns in this selector. The input argument can  accept a maximum of 10,000 IDs. If any more IDs are provided, any subsequent get() call on this selector will fail with an error.<br />
