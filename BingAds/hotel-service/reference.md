# Hotel API reference

> [!NOTE]
> This beta release of Hotel Ads is available to select participants only. For information about participating in the beta release program, please contact your account manager.
>
> The API and documentation are subject to change.

The Hotel API lets you manage your hotel ad campaigns and bidding.

## Endpoint

The following is the base URI that you use to construct the endpoint.  

`https://partner.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Travel/V1/`

The endpoint must include the customer and account resources.

`https://partner.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Travel/V1/Customers({customerId})/Accounts({accountId})/`

Set {customerId} to the customer's CustomerId and {accountId} to the customer's CustomerAccountId.

Next, append a template from the following table to add, get, and update hotel resources. For example, to get or add a hotel group, use the following endpoint:

`https://partner.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Travel/V1/Customers({customerId})/Accounts({accountId})/SubAccounts('{subAccountId}')/HotelGroups`.  

> [!NOTE]
> The IDs for SubAccounts, HotelGroups, and Hotels are strings and must be enclosed in single quotes. For example, SubAccounts('12345')/HotelGroups. This applies to SubAccounts, HotelGroups, and Hotels only; do not use single quotes for Customers and Accounts.

## Query Parameters

The following are the query parameters that the request may specify.

|Parameter|Description
|-|-
|<a name="count-param"/>$count|An OData parameter that determines whether the response includes an `@odata.count` field. Typically, you include this parameter when you request a list of entities, such as a list of hotel groups). The `@odata.count` field contains the total number of resource entities available, not those returned in the request. For example, if you set $top to 40, but 1,000 entities exist, `@odata.count` is set to 1,000, not 40. To include the count, set $count to **true**.
|<a name="select-param"/>$select|An OData parameter that specifies a comma-delimited list of the fields to include in the response. The field names are case sensitive. For example, to include the hotel's name, partner ID, and bid fields in the response, specify the following parameter:<br /><br />`$select=Name,PartnerHotelId,Bid` 
|<a name="skip-param"/>$skip|An OData parameter that specifies the number of resource entities to skip before returning entities. The $skip value must be a multiple of $top. If you specify a value that is out of range, the response contains an empty set. Use $top and $skip to page through a list of resource entities.
|<a name="top-param"/>$top|An OData parameter that specifies the number of resource entities to return. The default value is 1,000 and the maximum value that you may specify is 5,000. Use $top and $skip to page through a list of resource entities. 



## Headers

The following are the request and response headers.
 
|Header|Description|
|---------|---------------|
|<a name="authorization-hdr"/>Authorization|Request header.<br/><br/>Set this header to a bearer OAuth access token. For example, "Authorization: Bearer QTkxRUFBRjEzOTUyNEIx...". For information about getting a token, see [Getting Started](../hotel-service/get-started.md).
|<a name="contenttype-hdr" />Content-Type|Request and response header.<br/><br/>The type of content in the body of the request or response. For POST and PATCH, set this header to `application/json`.
|<a name="requestid-hdr" />X-MS-RequestId|Response header.<br/><br/>The ID of the log entry that contains the details of the request. You should always capture this ID if an error occurs. If you are not able to determine and resolve the issue, include this ID along with the other information that you provide the Support team.

> [!NOTE]
> This API supports using OAuth access tokens only for authentication (see the Authorization header). You may not use the UserName and Password headers to specify legacy credentials.
>
>This API does not require a developer token. If you include the DeveloperToken header, the API ignores it.
