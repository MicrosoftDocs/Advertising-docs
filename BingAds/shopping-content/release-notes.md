# Release Notes
This topic describes recent changes made to Version 9.1 of the Content API.

## July 2017

This release includes the following changes:

- Removed all references to version 9.0 from the document. Version 9.0 is no longer supported. 

## <a name="may2017"></a>May 2017
This release includes the following changes:

- The following [Product](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#product) fields are now required if the manufacturer assigns them.  
  
  - [brand](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#brand) 
  - [gtin](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#gtin) 
  - [mpn](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#mpn)  
  
  If the manufacturer assigns values for these fields, you must specify them in your offer. If you do not, BMC will accept the offer for now but will return a warning message in the response (see [warnings](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#warnings)). You should update your code at your earliest convenience to begin providing this information.  
  
- If you do not specify the `brand`, `gtin`, or `mpn` fields, you must set the [identifierExists](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#identifierexists) field to **false**. It's default is **true**.  
  
- Added the `warnings` field to the [BatchItemError](~/shopping-content/products-resource.md#batchitemerror) object.

 
## <a name="march2017"></a>March 2017
This release includes the following changes:

- Updated the documentation to reflect that your BMC store and catalogs are automatically enabled to use the Content API. You no longer have to use the Bing Ads web application to enable your store and catalogs to use the API.  

## <a name="february2017"></a>February 2017
This release includes the following changes:

- Updated the `Product` object's [availability](../shopping-content/products-resource.md#availability) field to accept *out of stock* and *preorder* values. Only users in the pilot program may specify these values.


## <a name="september2016"></a>September 2016
This release includes the following changes:

- Added the [promotionId](../shopping-content/products-resource.md#promotionid) field to the `Product` object. You use the promotion ID to associate a product offer with a promotion in your Promotions feed.
- Updated the [price](../shopping-content/products-resource.md#price) and [saleprice](../shopping-content/products-resource.md#saleprice) fields of the `Product` object to allow a minimum price of 0.0 (zero) under certain conditions. Previously, the minimum price allowed was 0.01 (1 cent).
