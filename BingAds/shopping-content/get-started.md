# Get Started with the Content API
## <a name="credentials"/> Do you have your Bing Ads credentials and developer token?
To use the Content API, you must have a Bing Ads account and credentials. New users to Bing Ads must use a Microsoft account to access Bing Ads. Current users that haven't transitioned to a Microsoft account may use their Bing Ads user name. 

To get a Bing Ads account, go to [http://bingads.microsoft.com](http://bingads.microsoft.com). If you're not signed in to your Microsoft account, you'll be redirected to sign in to your Microsoft account or sign up for a Microsoft account. After signing in, you'll have the option to **Sign up for a new Bing Ads account**. Select the sign up option and **Continue** with the sign up process.

Next, you'll need a developer token. To get a token to use in the production environment, see [Bing Ads Developer Portal](https://developers.bingads.microsoft.com/account). Click **Request Token** and provide the requested information. If you will be using the API to manage your own account, you'll receive your token immediately; however, if you'll be managing accounts for others, it may take up to five business days to get a token.

## <a name="authentication"/> Authenticating your credentials

Content API uses the same authentication schemes as Bing Ads API. If you use legacy credentials (i.e., username, password) with Bing Ads API, you may continue using them with Content API; however, customers are being asked to transition their legacy credentials to Microsoft account credentials. 

For details about authenticating Microsoft account credentials with OAuth, see [Authentication with OAuth](/bingads/guides/authentication-oauth). You *can* use the [Bing Ads SDK](/bingads/guides/client-libraries) for .NET, Java, or Python to authenticate both legacy and Microsoft account credentials (but only for authentication; the Bing Ads SDK does not provide interfaces for the Content API).

For an example that shows how to use OAuth to authenticate Microsoft account credentials, see [Authenticating Microsoft Account Credentials in C#](../shopping-content/code-example-authentication-oauth.md).

## Where to use your credentials and developer tokens?

All calls must specify the DeveloperToken header, and set it to the developer token that you were given.

All calls may specify either the AuthenticationToken header, if you use OAuth to authenticate your Microsoft account, or the UserName and Password headers, if you use legacy credentials.

If you manage catalogs on behalf of other customers, you must set the `CustomerId` header to the customer ID of the customer whose store you're managing, and the `CustomerAccountId` header to the account ID of any of the customer's accounts that you manage (it doesn't matter which managed account). 

For information about these and other headers that the request and response may contain, see [Headers](../shopping-content/products-resource.md#headers). 

## <a name="configurebmc"/> Configuring Bing Merchant Center to use the API

For an overview of Bing Merchant Center, see [What is Bing Merchant Center?](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51083/1) The topic includes links to all of the Merchant Center topics and related videos.

You must complete the following steps if you haven't already done so.

1. [Verify and claim your Website's URL](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50888/1)
  To get the webmaster tools mentioned in Verify and claim your Website's URL, see [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster). Sign in with the same Microsoft account that you use for Bing Ads. For more information about using the tool, see [Verify Ownership of Your Website](http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/how-to-verify-ownership-of-your-site-afcfefc6). 
2. [Create a Bing Merchant Center store](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51085/1)
3. [Add a catalog](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51105/1)

When you create a BMC store, the process creates a default catalog for you. The store and all catalogs that you create are automatically enabled for API management. The store contains a default catalog that all product gets, inserts, updates, and deletes apply to unless you specify the [bmc-catalog-id](../shopping-content/products-resource.md#bmccatalogid) query parameter in the resource URL. 

The **Store Setting** tab contains the Tenant URL, which you use as the base URI of your resource URL.

As an alternative to adding and enabling catalogs using the BMC web application, you may use the [Catalogs](../shopping-content/catalogs-resource.md) resource. For more information, see [Managing your Catalogs](../shopping-content/manage-catalogs.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> You may be able to use the API with FTP in certain circumstances to update a catalog feed. For information about using the API with FTP, see [Can I Use the API and FTP?](../shopping-content/can-use-api-ftp.md).
