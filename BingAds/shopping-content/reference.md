# Content API Reference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Bing Ads APIs, including Content API, will stop supporting managed user credentials (username and password) beginning August 1, 2018. At your earliest convenience, please migrate your account to use Microsoft accounts. For information, see [We're changing the way you sign in](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/ext50875/-1/en-us). You will also need to change your code to use OAuth for authentication. For details about using OAuth, see [Authentication with OAuth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingads/guides/authentication-oauth?view=bingads-12).
