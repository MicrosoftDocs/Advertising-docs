If you update your hotels' itinerary data using the Pull with Hints method, you use the Hint response message to specify the itinerary data that Bing should ask for in its pull requests. This topic describes the elements of the Hint response message defined by the [Hint XSD](https://bhacstatic.blob.core.windows.net/schemas/hint.xsd). 

For information about creating a Hint response message, see [Creating a Hint Message](../hint-message/create-hint-message.md).


> [!NOTE]
> Bing does not support all Hint XSD elements. This topic includes only those elements and attributes that Bing supports. Bing ignores all other elements and attributes. 


> [!NOTE]
> The elements must be specified in the order defined by the Hint XSD (and as listed in this topic).

| |The group that defines the options for specifying the exact date or date range that Bing should request data for. The option that you choose determines the elements that you include in the hint. |[itemmodechoicegroup](#itemmodechoicegroup)




<a name="itemmodechoicegroup" /> 
## itemmodechoicegroup
Defines the options for specifying the dates that Bing should request data for. 

|Element|Description|Children
|-|-|-
| |The first and last date of a date range. Bing will request itinerary data for stays that fall within the dates, including the specified dates. |[checkindategroup](#checkindategroup)
|StaysIncludingRange|The first and last date of a date range. Bing will request itinerary data for stays that fall within the dates, including the specified dates, and stays that intersect the dates.<br /><br />The difference between this date range option and the check-in date range option is that you must include all stays that intersect the date range. The effect of this is that the data you send will likely include data prior to `FirstDate`. For example, if `FirstDate` is 10/12/2017 and `AffectedNights` is 2, the data that you send should include data for the 10th and the 11th.  |[staysincludingrangetype](#staysincludingrangetype)
