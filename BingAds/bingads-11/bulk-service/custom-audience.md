# Custom Audience Record - Bulk
Defines a custom audience that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only update of the *Audience* (audience name) and *Description* fields are supported for upload. You can delete but cannot add a custom audience using the Bing Ads API. Having said that, you can add and delete ad group custom audience associations and exclusions.

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.

> [!TIP]
> For an overview of custom audiences see the [What are custom audiences and how do I set it up?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56849/-1) help topic.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Custom Audience* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Audience](#audience)
- [Audience Network Size](#audiencenetworksize)
- [Audience Search Size](#audiencesearchsize)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Description](#description)
- [Id](#id)
- [Membership Duration](#membershipduration)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Scope](#scope)
- [Status](#status)
- [Supported Campaign Types](#supportedcampaigntypes)

You can download all fields of the *Custom Audience* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CustomAudiences* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would update the description and membership duration of a custom audience. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Client Id,Modified Time,Name,Description,Membership Duration,Scope,Audience,
Format Version,,,,,,5,,,,
Custom Audience,Active,IdHere,ParentIdHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Updated Custom Audience Description,30,Account,Custom Audience,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkCustomAudience* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCustomAudience
var bulkCustomAudience = new BulkCustomAudience
{
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // CustomAudience object of the Campaign Management service.
    CustomAudience = new CustomAudience
    {
        // 'Audience Network Size' column header in the Bulk file
        AudienceNetworkSize = null,
        // 'Description' column header in the Bulk file
        Description = "Updated Custom Audience Description",
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = customAudienceIdKey,
        // 'Membership Duration' column header in the Bulk file
        MembershipDuration = null,
        // 'Audience' column header in the Bulk file
        Name = null,
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        ParentId = accountIdKey,
        // 'Scope' column header in the Bulk file
        Scope = null,
        // 'Audience Search Size' column header in the Bulk file
        SearchSize = null,
        // 'Supported Campaign Types' column header in the Bulk file
        SupportedCampaignTypes = null,
    },
                
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCustomAudience);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
