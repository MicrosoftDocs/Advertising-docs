# Campaign Product Scope Record - Bulk
Defines a campaign's set of product conditions that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For an *Campaign Product Scope* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Product Condition 1](#productcondition1)
- [Product Condition 2](#productcondition2)
- [Product Condition 3](#productcondition3)
- [Product Condition 4](#productcondition4)
- [Product Condition 5](#productcondition5)
- [Product Condition 6](#productcondition6)
- [Product Condition 7](#productcondition7)
- [Product Value 1](#productvalue1)
- [Product Value 2](#productvalue2)
- [Product Value 3](#productvalue3)
- [Product Value 4](#productvalue4)
- [Product Value 5](#productvalue5)
- [Product Value 6](#productvalue6)
- [Product Value 7](#productvalue7)
- [Status](#status)

You can download all fields of the *Campaign Product Scope* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CampaignProductScopes* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new campaign product scope given a valid campaign ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Bid,Name,Product Condition 1,Product Value 1,Product Condition 2,Product Value 2,Product Condition 3,Product Value 3,Product Condition 4,Product Value 4,Product Condition 5,Product Value 5,Product Condition 6,Product Value 6,Product Condition 7,Product Value 7,Is Excluded,Parent Criterion Id,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Campaign Product Scope,Active,,-113,,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,,Condition,New,CustomLabel0,MerchantDefinedCustomLabel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkCampaignProductScope* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCampaignProductScope
var bulkCampaignProductScope = new BulkCampaignProductScope
{
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // SharedEntityAssociation object of the Campaign Management service.
    CampaignCriterion = new CampaignCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        CampaignId = campaignIdKey,
        Criterion = new ProductScope
        {
            // Conditions are mapped to Product Value 1..7 and Product Condition 1..7 columns
            Conditions = new []
            {
                new ProductCondition
                {
                    // 'Product Value 1' column header in the Bulk file
                    Attribute = "New",
                    // 'Product Condition 1' column header in the Bulk file
                    Operand = "Condition",
                },
                new ProductCondition
                {
                    // 'Product Value 2' column header in the Bulk file
                    Attribute = "MerchantDefinedCustomLabel",
                    // 'Product Condition 2' column header in the Bulk file
                    Operand = "CustomLabel0",
                },
            },
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
    },

    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = null,
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCampaignProductScope);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
