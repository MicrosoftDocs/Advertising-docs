# Entity Hierarchy and Limits
The following figure shows the high level Bing Ads entity object model from the perspective of one customer that has one or more accounts. For information on services available to manage Bing Ads entities, see [Bing Ads API Overview](index.md).

![Entity Hierarchy](media/entity-hierarchy.png "Entity Hierarchy")  

A subset of entities with property limits (subject to change) are listed below. For a comprehensive list of entities and limits please see the [Bing Ads API reference](reference.md) documentation. For limits on request objects per service operation, see the [Ad Insight](../ad-insight-service/ad-insight-service-operations.md), [Bulk](../bulk-service/bulk-service-operations.md), [Campaign Management](../campaign-management-service/campaign-management-service-operations.md), [Customer Billing](../customer-billing-service/customer-billing-service-operations.md), [Customer Management](../customer-management-service/customer-management-service-operations.md), and [Reporting](../reporting-service/reporting-service-operations.md) reference documentation.  

> [!NOTE]
> The following are the standard limits. Please contact your account team if you have questions on limits that apply to your accounts.

## <a name="account"></a>Account

|Property|Limit|
|------------|---------|
|Name|The string can contain between 3 and 100 characters and must be unique among all account names within the customer.|

## <a name="adextensions"></a>Ad Extensions
Ad extensions let you decorate expanded text ads with additional information that helps customers find relevant information about your products and services. Ad extensions are stored in a shared library at the account level. After adding the extension to your shared library, you must also explicitly associate it with the account or one or more campaigns or ad groups within the account for the extension to become eligible for delivery. For more information, see [Ad Extensions](ad-extensions.md).

An account can contain up to 200,000 sitelink2 ad extensions. Outside of that limit, each account can contain up to 150,000 ad extensions of all other types combined.  

The entity (account, campaign, or ad group) to ad extension association limit varies by ad extension type. 

> [!NOTE]
> Call ad extensions can only be associated at the campaign level. 
> 
> Location ad extensions can only be associated at the account and campaign level i.e., cannot be associated with ad groups.
> 
> You must associate between 2 and 20 callout ad extensions per entity. If you associate one or fewer callout extensions with your account, campaign, or ad group, then no callout text will serve with your ad. An ad may include between 2 to 4 callouts per impression.
> 
> For each account, only 1,000 campaigns and 1,000 ad groups can be associated with image ad extensions.

Each account can contain 100,000 labels.

Although not pictured above, labels can be associated with campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords. You can apply one label to multiple entities. The association count is only limited by the number of campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords in your account.

|Description|The label description can be between 1 to 200 characters in length.|
|Name|The case-sensitive label name can be between 1 to 80 characters in length, and must be unique across all labels in the account.|

## <a name="negativekeywords"></a>Negative Keywords
To explicitly opt out of bidding for keyword match types, you can specify negative keywords at the campaign and ad group level.

Each ad group or campaign can contain up to 20,000 negative keywords, and each negative keyword can contain a maximum of 100 characters.

> [!NOTE]
> The 20,000 negative keyword limit is allowed per campaign and ad group up to the account limit of 5,000,000 negative keywords. These limits are separate from the limits for negative keyword lists.

Additionally a campaign can be associated with any or all negative keyword lists within the account, and each list can contain up to 5,000 shared negative keywords. A maximum of 20 negative keyword lists are allowed per account and each list can be associated with any or all campaigns in the account. Thus one campaign could effectively have 120,000 negative keywords applied via the sum of the 20,000 negative keywords exclusively set for that campaign and the 100,000 shared negative keywords (20 lists multiplied by 5,000 negative keywords per list).

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum number associations between campaigns and negative keyword lists is 50,000 per account. For example if you have five negative keyword lists and associate all of them with each of your 10,000 campaigns, then you are not allowed to associate a sixth negative keyword list with any campaign.

If you specify negative keywords at both levels, both lists will be used in comparison to the user's query. Thus an ad group could effectively have 140,000 negative keywords applied via the sum of the 20,000 negative keywords exclusively set for that ad group, the 20,000 negative keywords exclusively set for the ad group's parent campaign, and the 100,000 negative keywords in lists shared with the ad group's parent campaign.

For more information about managing negative keywords and negative keyword lists, please see the technical guide about [Negative Keywords](negative-keywords.md).

## <a name="negativesites"></a>Negative Site Placements
To prevent your ad from appearing on specific web sites within the search network you can configure website exclusions, also known as negative site placements. To explicitly opt out from having your search ads displayed on partner websites sites, you can specify negative sites at the campaign and ad group level. For search ads, you can specify only syndicated search websites. Ad-group-level website exclusions override campaign-level website exclusions.

You can manage negative site placements using the Campaign Management service ([AdGroupNegativeSites](../campaign-management-service/adgroupnegativesites.md)) and ([CampaignNegativeSites](../campaign-management-service/campaignnegativesites.md)).

Each ad group or campaign can contain up to 2,500 negative site placements. Each URL must specify the domain name e.g., *contoso.com* which can include up to three subdomains and two subdirectories. The subdomain count includes the *www* prefix. For example *one.two.three.contoso.com/1/2*, *www.two.three.contoso.com/1/2*, and *one.two.contoso.co.uk/1/2* are valid URLs, whereas *one.two.three.contoso.co.uk/1/2* (too many subdomains) and *one.two.three.contoso.com/1/2/3* (too many subdirectories) are not.

## <a name="productgroup"></a>Product Group
Product groups are used to specify which products from your Bing Merchant Center catalog should be included in a particular ad group. In order to understand product groups, first make sure you are familiar with [Product Ads](product-ads.md).

After you create a shopping campaign, Bing Ads creates a default ad group. That ad group includes a product group containing all of the products in your Bing Merchant Center catalog feed. However, you don't typically want an ad group to contain all products. Instead, you likely want each ad group to contain only very closely related products in order more effectively manage which ads show, and when. With product groups you can narrow down that default group to a customized list of specific products.

There is a 1 to 1 relationship between ad groups and product groups. In other words, each ad group has one product group and vice versa.

You can manage product groups using the Bulk service ([Ad Group Product Partition](../bulk-service/ad-group-product-partition.md)) or Campaign Management service ([ProductPartition](../campaign-management-service/productpartition.md)).

For more information, see the Bing Ads Help article [Understand and use product groups](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50901/1).


## <a name="targets"></a>Targets
You can set criteria to show your ads based on age, day and time, device, gender, and location. Where necessary to distinguish from other criterion types the documentation may refer to these entities as *target criterions*. For more information about managing targets, see the [Show Ads to Your Target Audience](show-ads-target-audience.md) technical guide.

The maximum number of age criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is five, i.e. one for each of the supported age ranges *EighteenToTwentyFour*, *TwentyFiveToThirtyFour*, *ThirtyFiveToFortyNine*, *FiftyToSixtyFour*, and *SixtyFiveAndAbove*.

The maximum number of day and time criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is 49. You may not specify any overlapping day and time ranges, for example Monday from 3:00AM to 5:00AM and Monday 4:00AM to 6:00AM are not allowed for the same campaign or ad group. Also for a given campaign or ad group, the maximum number of day and time criterions per day that you can specify is seven. For example you can specify up to 7 day and time criterions where the *Day* is set to Monday. 

The maximum number of device criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is three. You must either have three separate criterions for *Computers*, *Smartphones*, and *Tablets*, otherwise no device criterions can exist for the campaign or ad group.

The maximum number of gender criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is two i.e. one for *Male* and one for *Female*.

The maximum number of combined location and negative location criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is 10,000. For example, you may specify a maximum of 10,000 city location criteria or 1,000 state location criteria and 9,000 city location criteria. 

The maximum number of location intent criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is one.

The maximum number of radius criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is 2,000. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Each of these limits are independent of one another e.g., the radius criterions limit stands regardless of whether or not any location criterions exist for the campaign or ad group.
