# Get Started Using C# with Bing Ads Services
To get started developing Bing Ads applications with a .NET language, you can start with the [provided examples](code-examples.md) or follow one of the application walkthroughs for a [Web](walkthrough-web-application-csharp.md) or [Desktop](walkthrough-desktop-application-csharp.md) application. The examples have been developed with the Bing Ads .NET [SDK](client-libraries.md) and [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/). Your custom configuration may vary.

You will need user credentials with access to Bing Ads either in [production](https://secure.bingads.microsoft.com/) or [sandbox](https://secure.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Auth?EnvContext=Sandbox). For the production environment you will need a [production developer token](get-started.md#get-developer-token). All sandbox clients can use the universal sandbox developer token i.e., **BBD37VB98**. For more information, please see [Get Started With the Bing Ads API](get-started.md) and [Sandbox](sandbox.md).

To authenticate with a [Microsoft Account](https://account.microsoft.com/account) (email address username) in production, you must also must [register](authentication-oauth.md#registerapplication) an application and get the corresponding client identifier. You also need to take note of the client secret and redirect URI if you are developing a web application. For authentication details, see [Authentication With the SDKs](sdk-authentication.md#oauth).

## <a name="installation"></a>Install the SDK
To use the Bing Ads .NET SDK, you must first install and use .NET Framework 4.5 or later. In [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) go to the project **Properties** -&gt; **Application** -&gt; **Target framework** and make sure that **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected.

Install the Bing Ads .NET SDK through [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.BingAds.SDK/), either through the [Manage NuGet Packages](#manage-nuget) user interface, or through the [Package Manager Console](#package-manager). For information about installing NuGet, see [http://docs.nuget.org](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget).

> 
> -   *Microsoft.BingAds.dll* - The Bing Ads .NET [SDK](client-libraries.md)
> -   *System.Runtime.Serialization.dll*
> -   *System.ServiceModel.dll*
