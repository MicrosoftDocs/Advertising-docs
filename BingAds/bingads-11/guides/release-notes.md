-   [Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates](#sdk-april2018)   
-   [Product Match Count Report](#reporting-productmatchcount-april2018)   

### <a name="sdk-april2018"></a>Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, PHP, and Python SDKs are updated to support Bing Ads API Version 12. 

#### <a name="netsdk-april2018"></a>Bing Ads .NET SDK
The Bing Ads .NET SDK is updated to support .NET Standard 2.0. This will enable you to choose from a variety of platforms e.g., .NET Core or .NET Framework 4.6.1. For more information on .NET Standard and how it relates to other .NET frameworks, refer to this article on [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard). 

#### <a name="pythonsdk-april2018"></a>Bing Ads Python SDK
The version parameter is now required when creating each ServiceClient. Previously the version was optional and defaulted to version 11. The version parameter is moved to the second position between the service client name and the authorization data. 

The file_type parameter now defaults to 'Csv' as an *str* datatype instead of the DownloadFileType for BulkFileReader, BulkServiceManager, DownloadParameters and SubmitDownloadParameters. You can set 'Tsv' if you prefer the tab separated file format type.

### <a name="reporting-productmatchcount-april2018"></a>Product Match Count Report
The [ProductMatchCountReportRequest](../reporting-service/productmatchcountreportrequest.md) is added for Bing Shopping campaigns. You can include details in the report such as impressions, clicks, and spend that you can use to see if you are covering and bidding across your Bing shopping campaigns inventory. Note that this only provides the matched data for your current Product Group level, and you cannot obtain historical views.

## <a name="march2018"></a>March 2018

-   [Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates](#sdk-march2018)

Starting with Bing Ads API version 12, only OAuth authentication will be supported. Managed credentials i.e., the *UserName* and *Password* header elements are not supported. 

The Bing Ads Java SDK is updated to Java 1.7. As [announced previously](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bing_ads_api/2018/02/02/mandatory-upgrade-required-to-tls1-2/) at the end of March, we will disable TLS1.0/1.1 across all Bing Ads interfaces, and leave support for TLS1.2 only. You must upgrade at minimum to Java 1.7 e.g., update 131. 

### <a name="customaudiencedelete-march2018"></a>Custom Audience Delete
Bing Ads API now supports deletion of custom audiences via the [Custom Audience](../bulk-service/custom-audience.md) (Bulk API) and [CustomAudience](../campaign-management-service/customaudience.md) (Campaign Management API).

### <a name="audiencesearchsize-january2018"></a>Audience Search Size
You can find out the total number of people who belong to an audience i.e., custom audience, in-market audience, and remarketing list size. This gives you an idea of how many search users you can target.

You can fetch the audience search size in the *Audience Search Size* column of the [Custom Audience](../bulk-service/custom-audience.md), [In Market Audience](../bulk-service/in-market-audience.md), and [Remarketing List](../bulk-service/remarketing-list.md) Bulk records.

## <a name="august2017"></a>August 2017
For information about this month's changes to Bing Ads services, see the following sections.

-   [Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates](#sdk-august2017)  
-   [Increase in subdomain limit for website exclusions](#negativesites-august2017)  
-   [Geographical Locations File Version 2.0](#geo-locations-august2017)  
-   [New Reporting Columns for Location Targeting](#reporting-locations-august2017)  

### <a name="sdk-august2017"></a>Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, and Python SDKs are updated with support for the following features. Unless otherwise noted the changes only apply to Bing Ads API version 11. Some objects are reserved for future use, so please refer to the service reference documentation for availability details.

* The [Campaign Management]( release-notes.md#inheritedbidstrategytype-july2017) service proxies are updated to support inherited bid strategy type.  
* The [Reporting]( release-notes.md#reporting-bsc-july2017) service proxies are updated to support new columns for Bing Shopping campaigns.
* New version 11 bulk labels objects are added i.e., *BulkLabel*, *BulkCampaignLabel*, *BulkAdGroupLabel*, *BulkKeywordLabel*, *BulkAppInstallAdLabel*, *BulkDynamicSearchAdLabel*, *BulkExpandedTextAdLabel*, *BulkProductAdLabel*, and *BulkTextAdLabel* objects are added to the SDK for reading and writing the corresponding [Bulk file records]( release-notes.md#bulk-v11-labels-july2017).

* For the Bing Ads .NET SDK - Fixed the mapping for expired ad groups in the *BulkAdGroup* object. Previously if the ad group status in the bulk file was *Expired*, the SDK mapped and returned the value as *Deleted*. Prior to Bing Ads API version 10, expired ad groups were returned with a deleted status by design for backwards compatibility. 


### <a name="negativesites-august2017"></a>Increase in subdomain limit for website exclusions
The limit of subdomains allowed in a website exclusion increased from two to three, based on customer requests. This will enable you to exclude URLs based on two-part top-level domains (TLDs) such as *.co.uk*. The number of allowed subdirectories remains unchanged at two. 

For example, the following are valid URLs,
*  one.two.three.contoso.com/1/2  
*  www.two.three.contoso.com/1/2  
*  one.two.contoso.co.uk/1/2

The following are invalid URLs:
*  one.two.three.contoso.co.uk/1/2 (too many subdomains)  
*  one.two.three.contoso.com/1/2/3 (too many subdirectories)  

For reference documentation, please see [CampaignNegativeSites](../campaign-management-service/campaignnegativesites.md) and [AdGroupNegativeSites](../campaign-management-service/adgroupnegativesites.md).

### <a name="geo-locations-august2017"></a>Geographical Locations File Version 2.0 
The [GetGeoLocationsFileUrl](../campaign-management-service/getgeolocationsfileurl.md) operation now supports version 2.0. County location IDs are only available in version 2.0.

For more details about the contents of each file version, see [Geographical Location Codes](geographical-location-codes.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The locations file Version 1.0 is deprecated in favor of version 2.0. After October 31, 2017 version 1.0 will be sunset and only 2.0 will be supported. 

### <a name="reporting-locations-august2017"></a>New Reporting Columns for Location Targeting
The *County*, *LocationId*, and *PostalCode* columns have been added to the [GeographicPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/geographicperformancereportcolumn.md) value set.

## <a name="july2017"></a>July 2017
For information about this month's changes to Bing Ads services, see the following sections.

-   [Keyword Planner](#keyword-planner-july2017)  
-   [Labels](#labels-july2017)  
-   [Offline Conversion Import](#offline-conversions-july2017)  
-   [New Reporting Columns for Bing Shopping Campaigns](#reporting-bsc-july2017)  
-   [Inherited Bid Strategy Type](#inheritedbidstrategytype-july2017)
-   [Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates](#sdk-july2017)  

### <a name="keyword-planner-july2017"></a>Keyword Planner
Support for keyword planner operations is added. The Keyword Planner was already available in the Bing Ads web application, and now support is added for Bing Ads API version 11.

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword Planner features are currently available to customers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany.

Given a list of existing keywords, the [GetKeywordIdeas](../ad-insight-service/getkeywordideas.md) operation suggests new ad groups and keywords based on your existing keywords, website, and product category. You can also request historical statistics for keywords e.g., monthly searches, competition, average CPC, and ad impression share. You can use the returned suggested keyword bids as input to the [GetKeywordTrafficEstimates](../ad-insight-service/getkeywordtrafficestimates.md) operation.

The result is a [KeywordIdea](../ad-insight-service/keywordidea.md) list. Each keyword idea includes historical statistics for keywords e.g., monthly searches, competition, average CPC, and ad impression share. Whereas the Bing Ads web application returns a 12 month average of the historical monthly search counts, each [KeywordIdea](../ad-insight-service/keywordidea.md) includes a list of monthly search counts. You can use each count individually or average them for parity with the Bing Ads web application's calculation.

Once you have already settled on an initial set of keywords, the [GetKeywordTrafficEstimates](../ad-insight-service/getkeywordtrafficestimates.md) operation provides traffic estimates for keywords e.g., average CPC, average position, clicks, CTR, impressions, and total cost. As input you provide the keyword, bid, language, location, and network, with optional campaign budget and negative keyword filters.

The result is a [KeywordEstimate](../ad-insight-service/keywordestimate.md) list for each [AdGroupEstimate](../ad-insight-service/adgroupestimate.md), which are all nested within one [CampaignEstimate](../ad-insight-service/campaignestimate.md). Each keyword estimate includes a minimum and maximum [TrafficEstimate](../ad-insight-service/trafficestimate.md). As previously mentioned, the traffic estimates for keywords include average CPC, average position, clicks, CTR, impressions, and total cost.

For more details see the [Keyword Ideas and Traffic Estimates](keyword-ideas-traffic-estimates.md) technical guide.

### <a name="labels-july2017"></a>Labels
Support for labels is added. Labels let you organize campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords into groups based on whatever is important to you. You can then filter and run reports on your labels to get the data that is most meaningful to you.

#### <a name="bulk-v11-labels-july2017"></a>Bulk API Version 11 for Labels  
You can use the following Bulk record types to manage labels with the Bulk API.
-   [Label](../bulk-service/label.md)
-   [Campaign Label](../bulk-service/campaign-label.md)
-   [Ad Group Label](../bulk-service/ad-group-label.md)
-   [Keyword Label](../bulk-service/keyword-label.md)
-   [App Install Ad Label](../bulk-service/app-install-ad-label.md)
-   [Dynamic Search Ad Label](../bulk-service/dynamic-search-ad-label.md)
-   [Expanded Text Ad Label](../bulk-service/expanded-text-ad-label.md)
-   [Product Ad Label](../bulk-service/product-ad-label.md)
-   [Text Ad Label](../bulk-service/text-ad-label.md)

#### <a name="campaign-v11-labels-july2017"></a>Campaign Management API Version 11 for Labels  
You can add, delete, get, and update labels ([Label](../campaign-management-service/label.md) objects) with the corresponding operations.
-  [AddLabels](../campaign-management-service/addlabels.md)  
-  [DeleteLabels](../campaign-management-service/deletelabels.md)  
-  [GetLabelsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getlabelsbyids.md)  
-  [UpdateLabels](../campaign-management-service/updatelabels.md)  

You can set, get, and delete label associations ([LabelAssociation](../campaign-management-service/labelassociation.md) objects) with the corresponding operations.
-  [DeleteLabelAssociations](../campaign-management-service/deletelabelassociations.md)  
-  [GetLabelAssociationsByEntityIds](../campaign-management-service/getlabelassociationsbyentityids.md)  
-  [GetLabelAssociationsByLabelIds](../campaign-management-service/getlabelassociationsbylabelids.md)  
-  [SetLabelAssociations](../campaign-management-service/setlabelassociations.md)  

### <a name="offline-conversions-july2017"></a>Offline Conversion Import
Support for Offline Conversion Import is added. Use offline conversions to track the full impact and benefit of your search ads. It allows you to import offline conversions derived from a search click back into Bing Ads. 

To set up offine conversion tracking, create an offline conversion goal with the [Campaign Management](#campaign-v11-offline-conversions-july2017) service or via the Bing Ads web application, wait two hours, and then send Bing Ads the offline conversion data with either the [Campaign Management](#campaign-v11-offline-conversions-july2017) service or [Bulk](#bulk-v11-offline-conversions-july2017) service.

You must also enable MSCLKID Auto Tagging. Every time you add or update a new [OfflineConversionGoal](../campaign-management-service/offlineconversiongoal.md) via either the Bing Ads web application or Campaign Management API, the MSCLKID Auto Tagging is enabled automatically. You can enable or disable auto tagging using either the [Campaign Management](#campaign-v11-offline-conversions-july2017) service or [Bulk](#bulk-v11-offline-conversions-july2017) service. 

For more information, see [Tracking offline conversions](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/help:app54554/1/en-US/#ext:ConversionTracking-Load).

#### <a name="bulk-v11-offline-conversions-july2017"></a>Bulk API Version 11 for Offline Conversions  
You can send Bing Ads the offline conversion data by uploading one or more [Offline Conversion](../bulk-service/offline-conversion.md) Bulk records.

To manage the MSCLKID Auto Tagging, use the *MSCLKID Auto Tagging Enabled* field of the [Account](../bulk-service/account.md) Bulk record.

#### <a name="campaign-v11-offline-conversions-july2017"></a>Campaign Management API Version 11 for Offline Conversions  

You can manage [OfflineConversionGoal](../campaign-management-service/offlineconversiongoal.md) objects with the previously shipped conversion goal service operations e.g. [AddConversionGoals](../campaign-management-service/addconversiongoals.md).

You can send Bing Ads the offline conversion data by submitting [OfflineConversion](../campaign-management-service/offlineconversion.md) data via the [ApplyOfflineConversions](../campaign-management-service/applyofflineconversions.md) operation.

To manage the MSCLKID Auto Tagging, use the corresponding [AccountProperty](../campaign-management-service/accountproperty.md) (*MSCLKIDAutoTaggingEnabled*) via the [GetAccountProperties](../campaign-management-service/getaccountproperties.md) and [SetAccountProperties](../campaign-management-service/setaccountproperties.md) operations. 

### <a name="reporting-bsc-july2017"></a>New Reporting Columns for Bing Shopping Campaigns
The *ReturnOnAdSpend*, *BidStrategyType*, *LocalStoreCode*, and *StoreId* columns have been added to the [ProductDimensionPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/productdimensionperformancereportcolumn.md) value set.

The *ReturnOnAdSpend*, *BidStrategyType*, and *LocalStoreCode* columns have been added to the [ProductPartitionPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/productpartitionperformancereportcolumn.md) value set.

The *ReturnOnAdSpend*, *BidStrategyType*, and *LocalStoreCode* columns have been added to the [ProductPartitionUnitPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/productpartitionunitperformancereportcolumn.md) value set.

### <a name="inheritedbidstrategytype-july2017"></a>Inherited Bid Strategy Type
You can get the bid strategy type that is inherited from each ad group or keyword's parent campaign or ad group. This value is equal to the parent campaign or ad group's *Bid Strategy Type* field. Possible values are *EnhancedCpc*, *ManualCpc*, *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, and *TargetCpa*.

#### <a name="bulk-v11-inheritedbidstrategytype-july2017"></a>Bulk API Version 11 for Inherited Bid Strategy Type  
The *Inherited Bid Strategy Type* field is added to the [Ad Group](../bulk-service/ad-group.md) and [Keyword](../bulk-service/keyword.md) records. 

#### <a name="campaign-v11-inheritedbidstrategytype-july2017"></a>Campaign Management API Version 11 for Inherited Bid Strategy Type  
The *InheritedBidStrategyType* element is added to the  [InheritFromParentBiddingScheme](../campaign-management-service/inheritfromparentbiddingscheme.md) object. This element is not returned by default. You must include *InheritedBidStrategyType* in the *ReturnAdditionalFields* optional request element when calling [GetAdGroupsByCampaignId](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupsbycampaignid.md), [GetAdGroupsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupsbyids.md), [GetKeywordsByAdGroupId](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyadgroupid.md), [GetKeywordsByEditorialStatus](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyeditorialstatus.md), and [GetKeywordsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyids.md).


### <a name="sdk-july2017"></a>Bing Ads Software Development Kit (SDK) Updates
The Bing Ads .NET, Java, and Python SDKs are updated with support for the following features. Unless otherwise noted the changes only apply to Bing Ads API version 11. Some objects are reserved for future use, so please refer to the service reference documentation for availability details.

#### <a name="sdk-breaking-changes-july2017"></a>Breaking Changes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you upgrade to the latest SDK please note the following breaking changes.
* The *Status* property of the *BulkCampaignProductScope* object is removed. The Bulk file *Status* field is now mapped to the *Status* element of the *BiddableCampaignCriterion* of the *BulkCampaignProductScope*. 
* All BulkEntity derived SDK objects (except *BulkAdGroupProductPartition*) which previously contained the *AdGroupCriterion* or *CampaignCriterion* property are updated as either Biddable or Negative. Both the type and the name are updated e.g. *BulkAdGroupAgeCriterion* has property name *BiddableAdGroupCriterion* and data type *BiddableAdGroupCriterion*. The purpose is to be clear about the supported data type per bulk entity up front, rather than causing friction later i.e., runtime errors due to mismatch of BulkEntity to concrete criterion type. Several bulk entities were updated during the May 2017 release; and the remaining mappings are fixed with this release.
