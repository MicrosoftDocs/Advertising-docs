Bing Ads provides a variety of options for ads. You can extend the ad layout to be more visually appealing and feature rich using ad extensions.

|Topic|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[Ad Extensions](ad-extensions.md)|With ad extensions, you can decorate ads with additional information that helps customers find relevant information about your products and services. For example, you can include deep links into your website to quickly direct your customers to relevant promotional or technical information that may help increase conversions.|
|[App Install Ads](app-install-ads.md)|App Install Ads are similar to expanded text ads but provide direct links to your apps with a button, sending customers directly to the applicable store to download the application. This is an ideal solution for advertisers wanting to manage and drive downloads of their apps, rather than website traffic.|
|[Dynamic Search Ads](dynamic-search-ads.md)|Dynamic search ads provide a streamlined, low-touch way to make sure customers searching on the Bing Network find your products or services.|
|[Editorial Review and Appeals](editorial-review-appeals.md)|Learn about the editorial review process and how to determine whether ads or keywords passed or failed the review.|
|[Expanded Text Ads](expanded-text-ads.md)|The expanded text ad format works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices so you can focus more on crafting your longer ad copy and optimizing your ad text to better engage your customers before they click your ad.|
|[Intent Ads](intent-ads.md)|Native ads are an extension of search network, and are targeted to user intent based on various combinations of search history, page content, and past user behavior. Native ads are created automatically by Bing Ads leveraging all of your Bing Ads creative elements including ad title, text, URL, and ad extensions including image extensions. Native ads are a part of standard Bing Ads campaigns on the search network and support all of the targeting available from Bing Ads. Native ads have CPC pricing.<br/><br/>Intent ads are currently available to a limited number of customers and will only be shown on select premium publisher websites.|
|[Product Ads](product-ads.md)| Product ads from a Bing Shopping campaign include details about the product, an image, and optional promotional text. A Bing Shopping campaign enables you to advertise the products from your Bing Merchant Center store product catalog.|
|[Upgrade from Multiple Sitelinks to One Sitelink Per Extension](upgrade-sitelink2.md)|Use this guide to upgrade from multiple sitelinks to one sitelink per ad extension.|
