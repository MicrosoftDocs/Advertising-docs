# PagesViewedPerVisitGoal Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a pages viewed per visit conversion goal. Use this type of goal to count every time someone visits more than a specified number of pages on your website as a conversion. For example you can count a conversion if someone viewed more than 5 pages on a support site or product catalog.

> [!TIP]
> For an implementation overview, see the [Universal Event Tracking](../guides/universal-event-tracking.md) technical guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every time you create a new [DurationGoal](durationgoal.md), [EventGoal](eventgoal.md), [OfflineConversionGoal](offlineconversiongoal.md), [PagesViewedPerVisitGoal](pagesviewedpervisitgoal.md) or [UrlGoal](urlgoal.md) via either the Bing Ads web application or Campaign Management API, the *MSCLKIDAutoTaggingEnabled* value of the corresponding [AccountProperty](accountproperty.md) is set to *True* automatically. If the Scope of the goal is set to *Customer* level, then the [AccountProperty](accountproperty.md) for all accounts under the Customer will be set.

### <a name="inheritedelementsconversiongoal"></a>Inherited Elements from ConversionGoal
The [PagesViewedPerVisitGoal](pagesviewedpervisitgoal.md) object derives from the [ConversionGoal](conversiongoal.md) object, and inherits the following elements. The descriptions below are specific to [PagesViewedPerVisitGoal](pagesviewedpervisitgoal.md), and might not apply to other objects that inherit the same elements from the [ConversionGoal](conversiongoal.md) object.  

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="conversionwindowinminutes"></a>ConversionWindowInMinutes|The conversion window is the length of time in minutes after a click that you want to track conversions. If you set this value to 43200 minutes (30 days), then conversions that happen within 30 days after a click are tracked. Past conversions aren't affected. The minimum value supported is 1 minute, although keep in mind that a shorter conversion window will reduce the number of conversions your account records. The maximum value supported is 129600 minutes (90 days).<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**int**|
|<a name="counttype"></a>CountType|This determines how your conversions are recorded within your chosen conversion window.<br/><br/>There are two choices, and if you do not set a value the default is *All*:<br/><br/>- *All*:  All conversions that happen after an ad click will be counted. This is a common choice for sales. <br/><br/>-  *Unique*:  Only one conversion that happens after an ad click will be counted. This is a common choice for leads.<br/><br/>For example:  You track two conversions: leads and sales. You pick *Unique* for leads and *All* for sales. When one ad click turns into two leads and two sales, it's counted as three conversions: one for the unique lead, and two for all the sales.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[ConversionGoalCountType](conversiongoalcounttype.md)|
|<a name="id"></a>Id|The unique Bing Ads identifier for the conversion goal.<br/><br/>**Add:** Read-only<br/>**Update:** Required and Read-Only|**long**|

|<a name="revenue"></a>Revenue|Determines how much each conversion is worth to your business.<br/><br/>When adding a conversion goal if you do not specify any revenue tracking preferences, then each [ConversionGoalRevenue](conversiongoalrevenue.md) will be set to their respective default values.<br/><br/>When updating a conversion goal, if the *Revenue* element is nil or empty then none of the nested properties will be updated. However, if this element is not nil or empty then you are effectively replacing any existing revenue properties. <br/><br/> The *VariableValue* option is not available for pages viewed per visit conversion goals.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[ConversionGoalRevenue](conversiongoalrevenue.md)|
|<a name="scope"></a>Scope|Determines if the goal applies to all accounts or only the account specified in the required *CustomerAccountId* header element. If you have multiple Bing Ads accounts, you can track conversions across all of those accounts. If you associate a goal with one account, conversions will be tracked for that account only.<br/><br/>Possible values are *Account* and *Customer*. If not specified, the scope will be set to *Customer* by default. <br/><br/>Once you set scope, you can't change it. If you want to change the scope, you need to create a new conversion goal and pause the old one.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|[EntityScope](entityscope.md)|
