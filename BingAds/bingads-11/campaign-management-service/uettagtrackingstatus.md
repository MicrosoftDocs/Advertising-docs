# UetTagTrackingStatus Value Set - Campaign Management
Defines the possible system-determined status values of a UET tag. These are the status values that can be set by the system, for example the system sets the status to *Unverified* if the UET tag has not yet been verified. 

> [!NOTE]
> The *UetTagTrackingStatus* in part influences the system-determined [ConversionGoalTrackingStatus](../campaign-management-service/conversiongoaltrackingstatus.md) of any [ConversionGoal](../campaign-management-service/conversiongoal.md) that is associated with the [UetTag](../campaign-management-service/uettag.md). If the *UetTagTrackingStatus* is *Active* then the [ConversionGoalTrackingStatus](../campaign-management-service/conversiongoaltrackingstatus.md) can be either *NoRecentConversions* or *RecordingConversions*, and otherwise the conversion goal tracking status mirrors the tag status.  

## Syntax
```xml
<xs:simpleType name="UetTagTrackingStatus" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

    <xs:enumeration value="Unverified" />
    <xs:enumeration value="Active" />

|<a name="inactive"></a>Inactive|Bing Ads has not received any user activity data from the UET tag in the last 24 hours. Make sure that the UET tag tracking code is still on your website.|
