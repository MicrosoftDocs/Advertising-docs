# Profile Data Files
Profile data can be used to show ads to people in a specific company name, industry, or job function (according to LinkedIn). You can call the [GetProfileDataFileUrl](../campaign-management-service/getprofiledatafileurl.md) operation to get a temporary file URL that can be used to download the latest profile data. 

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice you should download the file instead of opening it directly through an application such as Microsoft Excel. If you view the profile data in a text editor, be sure to use UTF-8 encoding instead of ANSI, otherwise some characters will not be displayed accurately.

## <a name="profiletypes"></a>Profile Types
The company name, industry, and job function profile data are available in three seperate files i.e., companies.csv, industries.csv, and jobfunctions.csv.

Each comma separated value (CSV) file contains data organized in the following non-localized column headings. Only the Display Name and Descriptor columns are localized depending on the file URL used above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> New columns may be added at any time, so your implementation must ignore unknown columns.
> 
> The order of profile data is not guaranteed, so you should not take dependencies on any perceived column sort order or hierarchy.
