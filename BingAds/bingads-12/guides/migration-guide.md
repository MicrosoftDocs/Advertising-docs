> This Bing Ads API Version 12 preview documentation is subject to change. To return to version 11 content, use the version selector near the table of contents at the top and left side of the page.

# Migrate to Version 12
> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the availability of Bing Ads API version 12, version 11 is deprecated and will sunset by October 31, 2018. 

The sections below describe changes from version 11 to version 12 of the [Ad Insight](../ad-insight-service/ad-insight-service-reference.md), [Bulk](../bulk-service/bulk-service-reference.md), [Campaign Management](../campaign-management-service/campaign-management-service-reference.md), [Customer Billing](../customer-billing-service/customer-billing-service-reference.md), [Customer Management](../customer-management-service/customer-management-service-reference.md), and [Reporting](../reporting-service/reporting-service-reference.md) services. Some [authentication](#authentication) updates are required for all services. 

> [!NOTE]
> The features described below at times differ from the version 12 WSDL and reference documentation, as the latter are works in progress. You can take this guide as an overview of the changes either completed or planned to ship by the time version 12 is generally available. 

## <a name="authentication"></a>Authentication for All Services

### <a name="authentication-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="authentication-oauth-required"></a>Microsoft Account Authentication via OAuth is Required
Starting with Bing Ads API version 12, only OAuth authentication will be supported. Managed credentials i.e., the *UserName* and *Password* header elements are not supported. 

For more information on how to use OAuth with Bing Ads, see [Authentication with OAuth](authentication-oauth.md) and [Authentication With the SDKs](sdk-authentication.md).

#### <a name="authentication-multi-user"></a>Multi User Credentials
Previously one Bing Ads user could only access accounts within a single customer. You could manage accounts across multiple customers as an agency, however, you would have had to create a distinct user per customer. Now with multi-user credentials it is possible to use one Microsoft account and manage accounts across different customers. Your Microsoft account can be assigned a different user role (Super Admin, Standard User, Advertiser Campaign Manager, or Viewer) per customer that you can access. For example, your multi-user credentials grants you access to Customer A and Customer B. However, your Viewer user role for Customer A limits you from making any changes on the accounts that Belong to Customer A. But as a Super Admin for Customer B, you have full control over that customer's accounts. 

Please note the following changes from version 11 to 12 if you or one of your clients have setup [Multi-User Credentials for Customer Accounts](customer-accounts.md#multi-user). 

Starting with Bing Ads API Version 12 the multi-user credentials can access accounts across multiple customers. To switch context between customers you are required to set the CustomerId and CustomerAccountId header elements for Ad Insight, Bulk, Campaign Management, and Reporting services. 
> [!NOTE]
> The CustomerId and CustomerAccountId headers are not available for the Customer Billing and Customer Management services, because they automatically detect the customer context of the current authenticated user.

The merged credentials that could authenticate via Bing Ads API Version 11 will not authenticate via Bing Ads API Version 12. 
> [!TIP]
> To confirm availability, if the credentials no longer work via the Bing Ads web application (due to being merged for multi-user credentials via another email address), then the merged Microsoft account could still authenticate via Bing Ads API Version 11 but cannot authenticate via Bing Ads API Version 12.

## <a name="adinsight"></a>Ad Insight

### <a name="adinsight-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="adinsight-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client

Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/AdInsight/v12`.

The production endpoint is [https://adinsight.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v12/AdInsightService.svc](https://adinsight.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v12/AdInsightService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://adinsight.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v12/AdInsightService.svc](https://adinsight.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/AdInsight/v12/AdInsightService.svc).

#### <a name="adinsight-locationids"></a>Location Identifiers for Keyword Estimates
The list of *PublisherCountries* is replaced with a list of *LocationIds* for both the [GetEstimatedBidByKeywords](../ad-insight-service/getestimatedbidbykeywords.md) and [GetEstimatedPositionByKeywords](../ad-insight-service/getestimatedpositionbykeywords.md) operations. This change enables you to get more accurate estimates by refining the requested locations e.g., city or metro area.  

#### <a name="adinsight-keywordidea"></a>Keyword Idea Attributes
In version 12 all attributes within the [KeywordIdea](../ad-insight-service/keywordidea.md) are nillable i.e., AdImpressionShare, Competition, Relevance, Source, and SuggestedBid. If you do not request them, the [GetKeywordIdeas](../ad-insight-service/getkeywordideas.md) operation will return nil properties in the returned [KeywordIdea](../ad-insight-service/keywordidea.md). In addition the Competition [KeywordIdeaAttribute](../ad-insight-service/keywordideaattribute.md) is no longer required when calling [GetKeywordIdeas](../ad-insight-service/getkeywordideas.md). 

In version 11 if you didn't request AdImpressionShare, Relevance, Source, or SuggestedBid the [GetKeywordIdeas](../ad-insight-service/getkeywordideas.md) operation returned zero values (AdImpressionShare=0, Relevance=0, Source=Unknown, and SuggestedBid=0), although the values should not have been used. 

#### <a name="adinsight-currencycode"></a>ISO Currency Codes
The *Currency* value set is renamed as [CurrencyCode](../ad-insight-service/currencycode.md). The values are updated with ISO codes e.g., *USD* replaces *USDollar*.

The new value set is used with the [GetEstimatedBidByKeywords](../ad-insight-service/getestimatedbidbykeywords.md) and [GetEstimatedPositionByKeywords](../ad-insight-service/getestimatedpositionbykeywords.md) operations. 

The new value set is used with the [BidLandscapePoint](../ad-insight-service/bidlandscapepoint.md), [EstimatedBidAndTraffic](../ad-insight-service/estimatedbidandtraffic.md), and [EstimatedPositionAndTraffic](../ad-insight-service/estimatedpositionandtraffic.md) objects.

#### <a name="adinsight-traditionalchinese"></a>Traditional Chinese
To specify Traditional Chinese in version 12 you must use *TraditionalChinese* (without space) when setting the *Language* element e.g., for the [GetEstimatedBidByKeywords](../ad-insight-service/getestimatedbidbykeywords.md) and [GetEstimatedPositionByKeywords](../ad-insight-service/getestimatedpositionbykeywords.md) operations. Version 11 only supported *Traditional Chinese* (with space).

#### <a name="adinsight-keyworddemographic"></a>Keyword Demographic
The age range element names are updated within the [KeywordDemographic](../ad-insight-service/keyworddemographic.md) object.

Version 11|Version 12  
---------|---------
Age18_24|EighteenToTwentyFour
Age25_34|TwentyFiveToThirtyFour
Age35_49|ThirtyFiveToFourtyNine
Age50_64|FiftyToSixtyFour
Age65Plus|SixtyFiveAndAbove

#### <a name="adinsight-sunset-content"></a>Content Ad Distribution
The Content ad distribution is no longer supported in Bing Ads, and the *Content* value is removed from the [MatchType](../ad-insight-service/matchtype.md) value set. 

## <a name="bulk"></a>Bulk

### <a name="bulk-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="bulk-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client

Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/CampaignManagement/v12`.

The production endpoint is [https://bulk.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/BulkService.svc](https://bulk.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/BulkService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://bulk.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/BulkService.svc](https://bulk.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/BulkService.svc).


#### <a name="bulk-formatversion5"></a>Format Version 6.0

Support for Bulk file format version 5.0 is removed. Bing Ads API Version 12 only supports format version 6.0. When calling the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](../bulk-service/downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) and [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](../bulk-service/downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) operations you must specify *6.0* in the *FormatVersion* request element. When uploading a bulk file, you must specify 6.0 in the *Name* field of the [Format Version](../bulk-service/format-version.md) record. Changes to records between format version 5.0 and 6.0 are described in more detail in the following sections.

#### <a name="bulk-sitelinkadextensions"></a>Sitelink Ad Extensions
During calendar year 2017, Bing Ads upgraded all format version 5.0 *Sitelink Ad Extension* records (contains multiple sitelinks per ad extension) to *Sitelink2 Ad Extension* objects (contains one sitelink per ad extension). 

In Bing Ads API Version 12 the format version 5.0 *Sitelink Ad Extension*, *Campaign Sitelink Ad Extension*, and *AdGroup Sitelink Ad Extension* records are removed. Likewise, the *SiteLinksAdExtension*, *CampaignSiteLinksAdExtensions*, and *AdGroupSiteLinksAdExtensions* values are removed from the [DownloadEntity](../bulk-service/downloadentity.md) value set.

When you migrate to version 12 remove the '2' suffix from all *Sitelink2* records i.e., use the format version 6.0 [Sitelink Ad Extension](../bulk-service/sitelink-ad-extension.md), [Account Sitelink Ad Extension](../bulk-service/account-sitelink-ad-extension.md), [Campaign Sitelink Ad Extension](../bulk-service/campaign-sitelink-ad-extension.md), and [Ad Group Sitelink Ad Extension](../bulk-service/ad-group-sitelink-ad-extension.md) records. Likewise remove the '2' suffix from each [DownloadEntity](../bulk-service/downloadentity.md) value in version 12 i.e., use *SitelinkAdExtensions*, *AccountSitelinkAdExtensions*, *CampaignSitelinkAdExtensions*, and *AdGroupSitelinkAdExtensions*.

#### <a name="bulk-shoppingsubtype"></a>Shopping Campaign Sub Type
We are introducing Cooperative campaigns during calendar year 2018 as a sub type of Bing Shopping campaigns. More details about Cooperative campaigns are coming soon, and in the meantime please note the potential required changes in Bing Ads API Version 12 for your application to support existing Bing Shopping campaigns. Whether or not you plan to adopt Cooperative campaigns, you might need to make code changes if your application supports any shopping campaigns. 

When you download campaigns by including *Campaigns* from the [DownloadEntity](../bulk-service/downloadentity.md) value set, please check the *Campaign Type* and *Sub Type* fields of each [Campaign](../bulk-service/campaign.md). If the *Campaign Type* field is set to *Shopping* then you must also check the value of the *Sub Type* field. If the *Sub Type* field is empty then it is a standard Bing Shopping campaign. If the value is set to *CoOp*, the campaign is a Cooperative campaign. 

#### <a name="bulk-entityperformancedata"></a>Entity Performance Data
Bulk download of performance data is no longer supported. The EntityPerformanceData value of the [DataScope](../bulk-service/datascope.md) value set is no longer supported in Bing Ads API Version 12, and will be removed from the service contract in a future version. If you want data aggregated by day, week, or month, you can use the Bing Ads Reporting API. For more details see [Reports](reports.md).

#### <a name="bulk-audiencetargetingsetting"></a>Audience Targeting Setting
The *Remarketing Targeting Setting* field of an [Ad Group](../bulk-service/ad-group.md) is removed.

To determine whether the audience association is bid only or target and bid, use the *TargetSetting* field of an [Ad Group](../bulk-service/ad-group.md). The setting is applicable for all audiences associated with the ad group, including but not limited to remarketing lists. 

#### <a name="bulk-sunset-content"></a>Content Ad Distribution
The Content ad distribution is no longer supported in Bing Ads, and the *Content Bid*, *Content Network*, and *Search Network* fields of an [Ad Group](../bulk-service/ad-group.md) are removed from version 12. The ad distribution is effectively determined by the campaign type e.g., Search or Audience campaigns. The *Search Bid* field of an [Ad Group](../bulk-service/ad-group.md) is renamed *Cpc Bid*.

Likewise the *Campaign Type* value of the corresponding [Campaign](../bulk-service/campaign.md) is updated from *SearchAndContent* to *Search*. 

#### <a name="bulk-sunset-cpm"></a>Cpm Pricing Model
The CPM pricing model is no longer supported in Bing Ads, and the *Pricing Model* field of an [Ad Group](../bulk-service/ad-group.md) is removed from version 12. The *Pricing Model* field in version 11 was optional, defaulted to *Cpc*, and could only be set to *Cpc*. 

#### <a name="bulk-timezone"></a>Time Zone Updates
The following time zone values are updated for the *Time Zone* field of the [Campaign](../bulk-service/campaign.md) record. 
-  Since Magadan is now permanently in UTC+12 time zone, the value is updated from *MagadanSolomonIslandNewCaledonia* to *SolomonIslandNewCaledonia*.
-  The value is updated from *Almaty_Novosibirsk* to *AlmatyNovosibirsk*.
-  The value is updated from *MidwayIslandand_Samoa* to *MidwayIslandAndSamoa*.
-  The value is updated from *MountainTime_US_Canada* to *MountainTimeUSCanada*.

#### <a name="bulk-inmarketaudience-supportedcampaigntypes"></a>In-Market Audiences Supported for Audience Campaigns
In version 12 the AudienceNetworkInMarketAudiences and AudienceNetworkAudiences values are removed from the [DownloadEntity](../bulk-service/downloadentity.md) value set. In version 12 when you request in-market audiences via the InMarketAudiences or Audiences [DownloadEntity](../bulk-service/downloadentity.md) values, all of them will be returned. In version 11 the in-market audiences that are supported for Audience campaigns were not returned unless you included AudienceNetworkInMarketAudiences or AudienceNetworkAudiences in the download request. 

> [!NOTE]
> In both version 11 and 12 the *Supported Campaign Types* column is available with each [Custom Audience](../bulk-service/custom-audience.md), [In Market Audience](../bulk-service/in-market-audience.md), and [Remarketing List](../bulk-service/remarketing-list.md) record. You should first verify that the audience is supported for your campaign type before using it. 

#### <a name="bulk-errorcode-inmarketaudiencecouldnotbedeleted"></a>Error Code for InMarketAudienceCouldNotBeDeleted
In-market audiences cannot be deleted in both version 11 and version 12. Custom audiences can be deleted in both version 11 and 12. The error code CustomAudienceAndInMarketAudienceCouldNotBeDeleted (4860) that is still returned in version 11 is replaced by error code InMarketAudienceCouldNotBeDeleted (4864) in version 12.

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign Management

### <a name="campaign-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="campaign-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/CampaignManagement/v12`.

The production endpoint is [https://campaign.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/CampaignManagementService.svc](https://campaign.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/CampaignManagementService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://campaign.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/CampaignManagementService.svc](https://campaign.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/CampaignManagement/v12/CampaignManagementService.svc).


#### <a name="campaign-returnadditionalfields"></a>Return Additional Fields
The *ReturnAdditionalFields* element is removed from the [GetAdGroupsByCampaignId](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupsbycampaignid.md),[GetAdGroupsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getadgroupsbyids.md), [GetAudiencesByIds](../campaign-management-service/getaudiencesbyids.md), [GetKeywordsByAdGroupId](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyadgroupid.md), [GetKeywordsByEditorialStatus](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyeditorialstatus.md), and [GetKeywordsByIds](../campaign-management-service/getkeywordsbyids.md) request messages, and the corresponding elements of each [AdGroup](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md), [Audience](../campaign-management-service/audience.md), and [Keyword](../campaign-management-service/keyword.md) are returned by default.

#### <a name="campaign-sitelinkadextensions"></a>Sitelink Ad Extensions
During calendar year 2017, Bing Ads upgraded all version 11 *SiteLinksAdExtension* objects (contains multiple sitelinks per ad extension) to *Sitelink2AdExtension* objects (contains one sitelink per ad extension). 

In Bing Ads API Version 12 the *SiteLinksAdExtension* and *SiteLink* objects are removed. The *Sitelink2AdExtension* object is renamed [SitelinkAdExtension](../campaign-management-service/sitelinkadextension.md). Likewise, the *SiteLinksAdExtension* value is removed from [AdExtensionsTypeFilter](../campaign-management-service/adextensionstypefilter.md) value set, and the *Sitelink2AdExtension* value is renamed *Sitelink2AdExtension* (sans '2' suffix).

When you migrate to version 12 remove the '2' suffix from *Sitelink2AdExtension*, and otherwise the version 12 [SitelinkAdExtension](../campaign-management-service/sitelinkadextension.md) interface is identical to the version 11 *Sitelink2AdExtension* object. Likewise the ad extension [Type](../campaign-management-service/sitelinkadextension.md#type) value is *SitelinkAdExtension* when you retrieve a sitelink ad extension in version 12.

#### <a name="campaign-shoppingsubtype"></a>Shopping Campaign Sub Type
We are introducing Cooperative campaigns during calendar year 2018 as a sub type of Bing Shopping campaigns. More details about Cooperative campaigns are coming soon, and in the meantime please note the potential required changes in Bing Ads API Version 12 for your application to support existing Bing Shopping campaigns. Whether or not you plan to adopt Cooperative campaigns, you might need to make code changes if your application supports any shopping campaigns. 

When you call [GetCampaignsByAccountId](../campaign-management-service/getcampaignsbyaccountid.md) or [GetCampaignsByAccountId](../campaign-management-service/getcampaignsbyaccountid.md) and the [CampaignType](../campaign-management-service/campaigntype.md) is set to *Shopping*, please check the *SubType* of each [Campaign](../campaign-management-service/campaign.md). If the *SubType* is not set then it is a standard Bing Shopping campaign. If the value is set to *CoOp*, the campaign is a Cooperative campaign.

#### <a name="campaign-audiencetargetingsetting"></a>Audience Targeting Setting
The *RemarketingTargetingSetting* element of an [AdGroup](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md) is removed.

To determine whether the audience association is bid only or target and bid, use the [TargetSetting](../campaign-management-service/targetsetting.md) object via the *Settings* element of an [AdGroup](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md). The setting is applicable for all audiences associated with the ad group, including but not limited to remarketing lists. 

#### <a name="campaign-accountmigrationstatusinfo"></a>Account Migration Status Info
The *MigrationStatusInfo* (singular) element of an [AccountMigrationStatusesInfo](../campaign-management-service/accountmigrationstatusesinfo.md) object is renamed as *MigrationStatusInfos* (plural). This will resolve ambiguity between the returned name and data type.  

#### <a name="campaign-expandedtextaddomain"></a>Expanded Text Ad Domain
The *DisplayUrl* element of an [ExpandedTextAd](../campaign-management-service/expandedtextad.md) object is renamed as *Domain*.  

#### <a name="campaign-mediatype"></a>Media Type
The values returned in the *MediaType* and *Type* elements of a [Media](../campaign-management-service/media.md) object are swapped. In version 11 the derived media type of an [Image](../campaign-management-service/image.md) was returned in the *MediaType* element e.g., *Image*, and the aspect ratio was returned in the *Type* element e.g., *Image15x10*. In version 12 the derived media type of an [Image](../campaign-management-service/image.md) is returned in the *Type* element e.g., *Image*, and the aspect ratio is returned in the *MediaType* element e.g., *Image15x10*. Long term this should reduce friction for clients who depend on the derived type in the *Type* element.

#### <a name="campaign-sunset-content"></a>Content Ad Distribution
The Content ad distribution is no longer supported in Bing Ads, so the *AdDistribution* and *ContentBid* elements of an [AdGroup](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md) are removed from version 12. The ad distribution is effectively determined by the campaign type e.g., Search or Audience campaigns. The *SearchBid* element of an [AdGroup](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md) is renamed *CpcBid*.

Likewise the [CampaignType](../campaign-management-service/campaigntype.md) value is updated from *SearchAndContent* to *Search*, and the *Content* value is removed from the [MatchType](../campaign-management-service/matchtype.md) value set. 

#### <a name="campaign-sunset-cpm"></a>Cpm Pricing Model
The CPM pricing model is no longer supported in Bing Ads, and the *PricingModel* element of an [AdGroup](../campaign-management-service/adgroup.md) is removed from version 12. The *PricingModel* element in version 11 was optional, defaulted to *Cpc*, and could only be set to *Cpc*. 

#### <a name="campaign-timezone"></a>Time Zone Updates
The following time zone values are updated for the *TimeZone* element of the [Campaign](../campaign-management-service/campaign.md) object. 
-  Since Magadan is now permanently in UTC+12 time zone, the value is updated from *MagadanSolomonIslandNewCaledonia* to *SolomonIslandNewCaledonia*.
-  The value is updated from *Almaty_Novosibirsk* to *AlmatyNovosibirsk*.
-  The value is updated from *MidwayIslandand_Samoa* to *MidwayIslandAndSamoa*.
-  The value is updated from *MountainTime_US_Canada* to *MountainTimeUSCanada*.

#### <a name="campaign-batcherrorcollectioneditorial"></a>Batch Error Collection Editorial Errors
The Appealable, DisapprovedText, Location, PublisherCountry, and ReasonCode elements are added to the [BatchErrorCollection](../campaign-management-service/batcherrorcollection.md) object. 

#### <a name="campaign-agerange"></a>Age Range Values
The *ZeroToSeventeen* and *ThirteenToSeventeen* values are removed from the [AgeRange](../campaign-management-service/agerange.md) value set. These values were not ever supported. 

#### <a name="campaign-inmarketaudience-supportedcampaigntypes"></a>In-Market Audiences Supported for Audience Campaigns
In version 12 the ReturnSupportedCampaignTypes request element is removed from [GetAudiencesByIds](../campaign-management-service/getaudiencesbyids.md). Now when you request in-market audiences, all of them will be returned and will include the SupportedCampaignTypes element in each [Audience](../campaign-management-service/audience.md) object by default. In version 11 the in-market audiences that are supported for Audience campaigns were not returned unless you set ReturnSupportedCampaignTypes true. Effectively the ReturnSupportedCampaignTypes element in [GetAudiencesByIds](../campaign-management-service/getaudiencesbyids.md) version 11 gated both the SupportedCampaignTypes element for all audience types, as well as the in-market audiences that are supported for Audience campaigns. 

> [!NOTE]
> In both version 11 and 12 the *SupportedCampaignTypes* field is available with each [CustomAudience](../campaign-management-service/customaudience.md), [InMarketAudience](../campaign-management-service/inmarketaudience.md), and [RemarketingList](../campaign-management-service/remarketinglist.md) object. You should first verify that the audience is supported for your campaign type before using it. 

#### <a name="campaign-errorcode-inmarketaudiencecouldnotbedeleted"></a>Error Code for InMarketAudienceCouldNotBeDeleted
In-market audiences cannot be deleted in both version 11 and version 12. Custom audiences can be deleted in both version 11 and 12. The error code CustomAudienceAndInMarketAudienceCouldNotBeDeleted (4860) that is still returned in version 11 is replaced by error code InMarketAudienceCouldNotBeDeleted (4864) in version 12.

### <a name="campaign-newfeatures"></a>New Features

#### <a name="campaign-inheritedbidstrategytypes"></a>Inherited Bid Strategy Types
The *InheritedBidStrategyTypes* element is added to the response message of the [AddKeywords](../campaign-management-service/addkeywords.md) and [UpdateKeywords](../campaign-management-service/updatekeywords.md) operations.

Each string in the list is returned in the same order and corresponds to the keywords in the request message. The value of each string represents the type of bidding scheme (a.k.a. bid strategy type) that is inherited from the parent campaign or ad group. This element is not returned by default. You must set *ReturnInheritedBidStrategyTypes* true in the request.

## <a name="billing"></a>Customer Billing

### <a name="billing-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="billing-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/Billing/v12`.

The production endpoint is [https://clientcenter.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Billing/v12/CustomerBillingService.svc](https://clientcenter.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Billing/v12/CustomerBillingService.svc).

#### <a name="billing-billingdocumentinfo"></a>GetBillingDocuments by BillingDocumentInfo
In version 12 a structured list of [BillingDocumentInfo](../customer-billing-service/billingdocumentinfo.md) replaces the *DocumentIds* element in the [GetBillingDocuments](../customer-billing-service/getbillingdocuments.md) request. Now you can first call [GetBillingDocumentsInfo](../customer-billing-service/getbillingdocumentsinfo.md) and pass the results (up to 25 items) in the [GetBillingDocuments](../customer-billing-service/getbillingdocuments.md) request.  

The *CustomerId* element is added to the [BillingDocumentInfo](../customer-billing-service/billingdocumentinfo.md) object. When you call the [GetBillingDocuments](../customer-billing-service/getbillingdocuments.md) operation, both the *CustomerId* and *DocumentId* are required. 

#### <a name="billing-insertionorderstatus"></a>InsertionOrderStatus
The Pending and PendingSystemReview values are removed from the [InsertionOrderStatus](../customer-billing-service/insertionorderstatus.md) value set. The NotStarted value replaces Pending. 

### <a name="billing-newfeatures"></a>New Features

#### <a name="billing-insertionorderpendingchanges"></a>Insertion Order Pending Changes
In version 12 you can update you can update the comment, end date, name, notification threshold, purchase order, spend cap amount, and start date of insertion orders. Previously in version 11 you could only update the status of an [InsertionOrder](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md) to approve or decline an insertion order that was not yet approved and active.  

Before the insertion order becomes approved i.e., if the [InsertionOrder](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md) status is set to PendingUserReview, you can make updates via the [InsertionOrder](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md) object. Once the [InsertionOrder](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md) status is Active, Exhausted, Expired, or NotStarted, then you can either make new changes or approve or decline the current pending changes via the [InsertionOrderPendingChanges](../customer-billing-service/insertionorderpendingchanges.md) object. You can discover pending changes via [SearchInsertionOrders](../customer-billing-service/searchinsertionorders.md), and then call [UpdateInsertionOrder](../customer-billing-service/updateinsertionorder.md) to change the status or update the insertion order settings. If the [InsertionOrder](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md) status is Canceled or Declined then you cannot update the insertion order. 

In version 11 you could find out if pending changes were available via the ChangePendingReview element of an insertion order. The [PendingChanges](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md#pendingchanges) element replaces it. Also note that the *InsertionOrderId* was renamed as [Id](../customer-billing-service/insertionorder.md#id) for consistency with other objects.

## <a name="customer"></a>Customer Management

### <a name="customer-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="customer-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/Customer/v12`.

The production endpoint is [https://clientcenter.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/CustomerManagement/v12/CustomerManagementService.svc](https://clientcenter.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/CustomerManagement/v12/CustomerManagementService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://clientcenter.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/CustomerManagement/v12/CustomerManagementService.svc](https://clientcenter.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/CustomerManagement/v12/CustomerManagementService.svc).

#### <a name="customer-multi-user"></a>Multi User Credentials
With [multi-user credentials](#authentication-multi-user), one email address can be associated with multiple roles i.e., one role for each customer they can access. Whether or not you have "multi-user" credentials, the Customer Management API maps your credentials via a single [User](../customer-management-service/user.md) object, with some notable changes to the returned user roles. 

The *Accounts*, *Customers*, and *Roles* elements of the [GetUser](../customer-management-service/getuser.md) response are replaced with a list of [CustomerRole](../customer-management-service/customerrole.md) objects named *CustomerRoles*. 

In the response message for *GetUser* in version 11, the returned role or roles were applicable for all accounts or customers listed. You will only see the role(s) that the user had before multi-user credentials consolidation. 

```xml

</Customers>
```

In the response message for [GetUser](../customer-management-service/getuser.md) in version 12, each returned role is mapped to a specific customer (and specific accounts if applicable). You can see the roles for all customers that the user can access before and after multi-user credentials consolidation. 

```xml
<CustomerRoles xmlns:e328="https://bingads.microsoft.com/Customer/v12/Entities" d4p1:nil="false" xmlns:d4p1="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <e328:CustomerRole>
    <e328:RoleId>ValueHere</e328:RoleId>
    <e328:CustomerId>ValueHere</e328:CustomerId>
    <e328:AccountIds d4p1:nil="false" xmlns:a1="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays">
    <a1:long>ValueHere</a1:long>
    </e328:AccountIds>
  </e328:CustomerRole>
</CustomerRoles>
```

Let's consider the following user roles and permissions before multi-user consolidation. Each user must log in separately and has different permissions during each logged in session. Likewise via the API each user's access token (see [Authentication with OAuth](authentication-oauth.md)) represents permissions limited to the corresponding user and role. 

|User|Role|Permissions|
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
|one@contoso.com|Viewer|Customer A - All Accounts|
|two@contoso.com|Super Admin|Customer B - All Accounts|
|three@contoso.com|Viewer|Customer C - Account A|
|four@contoso.com|Standard User|Customer B - All Accounts|

First please note that only one email address per customer can be consolidated, so in this example two@contoso.com and four@contoso.com cannot be consolidated together. Now let's see what happens after the top three users are consolidated under one@contoso.com. 
  * No changes for user four@contoso.com whether via the Bing Ads web application, Bing Ads Editor, or API. 
  * The user one@contoso.com can log in via the Bing Ads web application and Bing Ads Editor. The consolidated users i.e., two@contoso.com and three@contoso.com no longer have permissions to sign in via the Bing Ads web application or Bing Ads Editor. While signed in as one@contoso.com, you can switch context to the customer accounts with corresponding user roles that had previously been assigned to two@contoso.com and three@contoso.com. Although you can access multiple customers signed in with one user's credentials (one@contoso.com), you will need to switch from customer to customer to manage the accounts that are linked with unique user roles. Customers and their related accounts remain distinct. For more details see the Bing Ads help topic [Managing your user name to access multiple accounts](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/app54567/1/en-US/#ext:Customers_Management).
  * With Bing Ads API version 11 there is no change to access before versus after multi-user consolidation. Each of the user's access token (see [Authentication with OAuth](authentication-oauth.md)) represents permissions limited to the corresponding user and role. 
  * Starting with Bing Ads API version 12, the access token for user one@contoso.com will represent permissions to the consolidated list (superset) of accounts. The user role in effect will depend on the customer and account identifiers specified in the service request. Access tokens for two@contoso.com and three@contoso.com will no longer be accepted. 
  * The *UserName* returned via [GetUser](../customer-management-service/getuser.md) and [GetUsersInfo](../customer-management-service/getusersinfo.md) will differ between version 11 and 12 for two@contoso.com and three@contoso.com. In version 11 the *UserName* will be two@contoso.com and three@contoso.com, whereas in version 12 the *UserName* for each of the corresponding user identifiers will be one@contoso.com. In other words the operations will always return whatever user name can authenticate using the respective API version.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the multi-user credentials were provisioned through the user invitation work flow i.e., there was never an "old user name" for access to a customer, a system generated GUID will be returned in the *UserName* element in version 11. In version 12 the multi-user email address will be returned. 
  
Also of note is that the Name, Lcid, JobTitle, and ContactInfo user settings for the same person will be automatically synchronized with any updates that occur after user consolidation. The LastModifiedByUserId and LastModifiedTime are also in sync across each returned [User](../customer-management-service/user.md) object, unless you had an old username merged and have not updated any user settings since the consolidation. 
> [!NOTE]
> The TimeStamp differs from the LastModifiedTime. All TimeStamp values are unique per User and when you call [UpdateUser](../customer-management-service/updateuser.md) you must include the corresponding user's timestamps (including the address timestamp).

For example let's say you haven't updated user information for one@contoso.com since prior to consolidation with two@contoso.com and three@contoso.com. After consolidation and until the user settings are updated post-consolidation, you will continue to observe a distinct LastModifiedByUserId and LastModifiedTime within each returned [User](../customer-management-service/user.md) object.

|User Id|Contact Info Id|Permissions|LastModifiedByUserId|
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
|123|234|Customer A - All Accounts|123|
|456|567|Customer B - All Accounts|456|
|789|890|Customer C - Account A|789|

Now let's say that one@contoso.com is acting in the context of Customer B and updates their contact information. The updated contact information as well as the same LastModifiedByUserId and LastModifiedTime are now syncrhonized across all returned [User](../customer-management-service/user.md) objects.

|User Id|Contact Info Id|Permissions|LastModifiedByUserId|
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
|123|234|Customer A - All Accounts|456|
|456|567|Customer B - All Accounts|456|
|789|890|Customer C - Account A|456|

#### <a name="customer-userroles"></a>User Roles
The *UserRole* value set is removed to ensure consistent mapping and forward compatibility for potential new user roles. In turn, the *Role* element of the [UserInvitation](../customer-management-service/userinvitation.md) object is replaced with an int value i.e., an element named *RoleId*.

#### <a name="customer-advertiseraccount"></a>Advertiser Account
The [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) object no longer derives from an *Account* base. The *Account* object is removed and its properties are moved directly to the [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) object. 

Also because only one account type is supported, the *AccountType* and *ApplicationType* value sets are removed. In turn the *AccountType* element is removed from the [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) object, the *CustomerAppScope* element is removed from the [User](../customer-management-service/user.md) object, and the *ApplicationScope* request element is removed from the [FindAccounts](../customer-management-service/findaccounts.md), [FindAccountsOrCustomersInfo](../customer-management-service/findaccountsorcustomersinfo.md), [GetCustomersInfo](../customer-management-service/getcustomersinfo.md), and [SignupCustomer](../customer-management-service/signupcustomer.md) operations. 

#### <a name="customer-businessaddress"></a>Business Address
The *CustomerAddress* element is removed from the [Customer](../customer-management-service/customer.md) object. Instead, the *BusinessAddress* of each [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) will be required. 

The *BusinessName* element is added to the [Address](../customer-management-service/address.md) object. It is required for *BusinessAddress* of each [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md), and ignored if you set it with the [User](../customer-management-service/user.md) address. 

#### <a name="customer-advertiseraccount"></a>AutoTag Type
The *AutoTag* key and value pair is removed from the *ForwardCompatibilityMap* element of the [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) object. Instead the *AutoTagType* element is added to the [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md). The new [AutoTagType](../customer-management-service/autotagtype.md) values are *Inactive*, *Preserve*, and *Replace*. If you used values 0, 1, or 2 in the version 11 *AutoTag*, then you can replace them with the version 12 auto tag type as follows.

Version 11|Version 12  
---------|---------
0|Inactive
1|Preserve
2|Replace

#### <a name="customer-advertiseraccount"></a>Tracking Url Template
The *TrackingUrlTemplate* key and value pair is removed from the *ForwardCompatibilityMap* element of the [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) object. Instead you can set the [AccountProperty](../campaign-management-service/accountproperty.md) name for *TrackingUrlTemplate* via the Campaign Management service, or set the *Tracking Template* field of the [Account](../bulk-service/account.md) record via the Bulk service.  

#### <a name="customer-currencycode"></a>ISO Currency Codes
The *CurrencyType* value set is renamed as [CurrencyCode](../customer-management-service/currencycode.md). The values are updated with ISO codes e.g., *USD* replaces *USDollar*. The new value set is used with the [AdvertiserAccount](../customer-management-service/advertiseraccount.md) object. 

#### <a name="customer-timezone"></a>Time Zone Updates
The following values are updated in the [TimeZoneType](../customer-management-service/timezonetype.md) value set. 
-  Since Magadan is now permanently in UTC+12 time zone, the value is updated from *MagadanSolomonIslandNewCaledonia* to *SolomonIslandNewCaledonia*.
-  The value of *InternationalDatelineWest* (lowercase 'l' in Dateline) is updated to *InternationalDateLineWest* (uppercase 'L' in DateLine). 

#### <a name="customer-searchcustomers-predicates"></a>Search Customers Predicates
The following [Predicate](../customer-management-service/predicate.md#searchcustomers) field and operator sets are no longer available in version 12. 
-  PersonName Equals
-  PersonName Contains
-  Email Equals
-  Email Contains
-  UserName Contains (UserName Equals is still available in version 12)

### <a name="reporting-breakingchanges"></a>Breaking Changes

#### <a name="reporting-proxy-client"></a>Proxy Client
Update your proxy client to use the new endpoint address and namespace.

The namespace is `https://bingads.microsoft.com/Reporting/v12`.

The production endpoint is [https://reporting.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/Reporting/v12/ReportingService.svc](https://reporting.api.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/Reporting/v12/ReportingService.svc).

The sandbox endpoint is [https://reporting.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/Reporting/v12/ReportingService.svc](https://reporting.api.sandbox.bingads.microsoft.com/Api/Advertiser/Reporting/v12/ReportingService.svc).

#### <a name="reporting-downloadedcolumns"></a>Consistency Between WSDL Contract and Downloaded Report Columns
Previously there were some discrepancies between the report column value set names and the names of the columns in the downloaded reports. In Reporting API Version 12 all of the downloaded column names match the requested value. For example now when you submit a [KeywordPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportrequest.md) with the *BidStrategyType* value from the [KeywordPerformanceReportColumn](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportcolumn.md) value set, the column name in the downloaded report is also *BidStrategyType* in Reporting API Version 12. Previously in version 11, the column name in the downloaded report was *Bid strategy type*.

The following column names have changed in the downloaded reports from version 11 to 12.

Version 11|Version 12  
---------|---------
AudienceTargetSetting|TargetingSetting
AutoTarget|DynamicAdTarget
AutoTargetId|DynamicAdTargetId
AutoTargetStatus|DynamicAdTargetStatus
AvgCPP|AverageCpp
BenchmarkCTR|BenchmarkCtr
Bid strategy type|BidStrategyType
BusinessCatId|BusinessCategoryId
BusinessCatName|BusinessCategoryName
CallDuration|Duration
CallEndTime|EndTime
CallStartTime|StartTime
CallStatusName|CallStatus
ClickSharePct|ClickSharePercent
ClickTypeID|ClickTypeId
CountryOrRegion|Country
Device type|DeviceType
DSAFinalURL|FinalUrl
FinalAppUrl|FinalAppURL
FinalMobileUrl|FinalMobileURL
FinalUrl|FinalURL
FirstLevelCategory|Category1
Localstorecode|LocalStoreCode
NegativeKeywordListName|NegativeKeywordList
NegativeKeywordMatchTypeDesc|NegativeKeywordMatchType
NodeId|AdGroupCriterionId
ProductPartitionType|PartitionType
PTR|Ptr
Search query|SearchQuery
SecondLevelCategory|Category2
Status|CampaignStatus
TopLevelCategory|Category0

In addition when you include the TimePeriod column in version 12 the name of the column in the downloaded report will likewise be TimePeriod. In version 11 the column name varied by aggregation as follows.

|Aggregation|Version 11 Column Name|
|---------------|---------------|
|Daily|GregorianDate|
|DayOfWeek|DayOfWeek|
|Hourly|Hour, GregorianDate|
|HourOfDay|HourOfDay|
|Monthly|MonthStartDate|
|Weekly|WeekStartDate|
|Yearly|Year|

Whereas in version 11 the time period for Hourly aggregation was split across two columns, in version 12 it will be formatted in the TimePeriod column with the date and hour (int value) delimited by a semicolon e.g., *yyyy-mm-dd;hour*. For more details see [ReportAggregation](../reporting-service/reportaggregation.md) and [TimePeriod Column](reports.md#timeperiod).

#### <a name="reporting-columnrestrictions"></a>Column Restrictions
For some reports you cannot include constrained attributes in the same report request. For example when submitting the [AccountPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/accountperformancereportrequest.md) and [AdGroupPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/adgroupperformancereportrequest.md) if you include any of the impression share performance statistics columns, then you must exclude the *BidMatchType*, *DeviceOS*, and *TopVsOther* attribute columns. Likewise, if you include any of these attribute columns, then you must exclude all of the impression share performance statistics columns.

Starting with Bing Ads API Version 12, an error will be returned if you include any constrained report column combinations. Using Bing Ads API Version 11 the report submission did not fail; however, the fields returned in the downloaded report would be 0 (zero) in place of any meaningful data.

For more details, see [Column Restrictions in Reports](reports.md#columnrestrictions).

#### <a name="reporting-reportaggregation"></a>Report Aggregation
For parity with aggregation options (unit of time) in the Bing Ads web application, Bing Ads API Version 12 enables comparable time periods that previously were not supported via Bing Ads API Version 11. The *NonHourlyReportAggregation* and *SearchQueryReportAggregation* value sets are removed, and you should use [ReportAggregation](../reporting-service/reportaggregation.md) values for all reports.

When submitting the following report requests, you must use the [ReportAggregation](../reporting-service/reportaggregation.md) data type instead of *NonHourlyReportAggregation* within the *ReportAggregation* element. Although the [ReportAggregation](../reporting-service/reportaggregation.md) value set includes additional aggregation periods, unless otherwise noted below these reports are still limited to Summary, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly aggregation. If you submit a report with an invalid aggregation period, the API will return error code 2007, ReportingServiceInvalidReportAggregation. 

Report Request|Aggregation Periods Added in Version 12  
---------|---------
[AdDynamicTextPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/addynamictextperformancereportrequest.md)|Hourly
[AdPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/adperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay
[AgeGenderDemographicReportRequest](../reporting-service/agegenderdemographicreportrequest.md)|None
[ConversionPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/conversionperformancereportrequest.md)|None
[DestinationUrlPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/destinationurlperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay
[DSAAutoTargetPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/dsaautotargetperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay
[DSACategoryPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/dsacategoryperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay
[GeographicPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/geographicperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay
[GoalsAndFunnelsReportRequest](../reporting-service/goalsandfunnelsreportrequest.md)|None
[PublisherUsagePerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/publisherusageperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay
[ShareOfVoiceReportRequest](../reporting-service/shareofvoicereportrequest.md)|None
[UserLocationPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/userlocationperformancereportrequest.md)|DayOfWeek, Hourly, HourOfDay

When submitting the following report requests, you must use the [ReportAggregation](../reporting-service/reportaggregation.md) data type instead of *SearchQueryReportAggregation* within the *ReportAggregation* element.
-  [DSASearchQueryPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/dsasearchqueryperformancereportrequest.md)
-  [SearchQueryPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/searchqueryperformancereportrequest.md)

#### <a name="reporting-sunset-content"></a>Content Ad Distribution
The Content ad distribution is no longer supported in Bing Ads, and the *Content* value is removed from the [AdDistributionReportFilter](../reporting-service/addistributionreportfilter.md), [BidMatchTypeReportFilter](../reporting-service/bidmatchtypereportfilter.md), and [DeliveredMatchTypeReportFilter](../reporting-service/deliveredmatchtypereportfilter.md) value sets. 

### <a name="reporting-newfeatures"></a>New Features

#### <a name="reporting-reporttimezone"></a>Report Time Zone
Bing Ads API version 12 now lets you choose a [ReportTimeZone](../reporting-service/reporttimezone.md) when you submit a [ReportRequest](../reporting-service/reportrequest.md) via the [BudgetSummaryReportTime](../reporting-service/budgetsummaryreporttime.md) or [ReportTime](../reporting-service/reporttime.md) objects. The time zone can help you accurately scope data for the selected date range. 

#### <a name="reporting-reporttimeperiod"></a>More Flexible Report Time Periods
Bing Ads API version 12 now lets you choose *LastFourteenDays* and *LastThirtyDays* from the [ReportTimePeriod](../reporting-service/reporttimeperiod.md) value set when you submit a report request.
