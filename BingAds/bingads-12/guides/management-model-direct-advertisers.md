# Management Model for Direct Advertisers
A direct advertiser builds a Bing Ads application for its own advertising campaigns and is billed directly by Bing Ads for valid ad clicks. The following sections describe the entity model and credentials for direct advertisers.

## Direct Advertiser Entity Model

The users of a direct advertiser can programmatically manage any designated accounts within their own customer, for example Account A and Account B. An application owned and operated by the direct advertiser may be used to manage some or all aspects of an advertiser account. Users can also manage their respective account through the Bing Ads web application or a third-party tool.
