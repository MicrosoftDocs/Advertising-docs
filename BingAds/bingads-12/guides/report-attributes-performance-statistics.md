# Report Attributes and Performance Statistics
Each of the [Report Types](report-types.md) contains a subset of attributes and performance statistics. When submitting a report request, you must include [Attributes](#attributes) and [Performance Statistics](#performancestatistics) columns. The downloaded report will then include renamed columns (fields) corresponding to each column that you included in the report request. For information about required and optional columns, see the corresponding report column value set within [Reporting Value Sets](../reporting-service/reporting-value-sets.md). For example to determine which columns are required and optional for a [KeywordPerformanceReportRequest](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportrequest.md), see [KeywordPerformanceReportColumn Value Set](../reporting-service/keywordperformancereportcolumn.md).

A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. Traffic for syndicated networks do not affect quality score. The value in the report will be blank if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more.<br /><br />Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day.<br /><br />If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated.<br /><br />If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period.
