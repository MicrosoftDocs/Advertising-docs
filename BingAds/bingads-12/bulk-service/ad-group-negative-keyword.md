# Ad Group Negative Keyword Record - Bulk
Defines a negative keyword assigned to an ad group that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

In the bulk schema each of the negative keywords associated with an ad group are represented individually by their own row. For example if an ad group has two negative keywords, they are represented by two *Ad Group Negative Keyword* records in the bulk file with *Status* set to Active.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Ad Group Negative Keyword* can be added and deleted, but cannot be updated.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For an *Ad Group Negative Keyword* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Id](#id)
- [Keyword](#keyword)
- [Match Type](#matchtype)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Status](#status)

You can download all fields of the *Ad Group Negative Keyword* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroupNegativeKeywords* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group negative keyword given a valid ad group ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Keyword,Match Type,Name
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,6
Ad Group Negative Keyword,Active,,-1111,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,shoes,Exact,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkAdGroupNegativeKeyword* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAdGroupNegativeKeyword
var bulkAdGroupNegativeKeyword = new BulkAdGroupNegativeKeyword
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = null,
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = null,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // NegativeKeyword object of the Campaign Management service.
    NegativeKeyword = new NegativeKeyword
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Match Type' column header in the Bulk file
        MatchType = MatchType.Exact,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "shoes"
    },
                
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAdGroupNegativeKeyword);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
