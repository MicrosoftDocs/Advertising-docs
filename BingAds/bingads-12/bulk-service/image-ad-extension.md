# Image Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines an image ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

You can associate an image ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. For each account, only 1,000 campaigns and 1,000 ad groups can be associated with image ad extensions. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 6 image ad extensions. Use the [Account Image Ad Extension](account-image-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Image Ad Extension](ad-group-image-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Image Ad Extension](campaign-image-ad-extension.md) records to manage image ad extension associations.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For an *Image Ad Extension* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Schedule](#adschedule)
- [Alternative Text](#alternativetext)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Destination Url](#destinationurl)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)
- [Id](#id)
- [Media Ids](#mediaids)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Start Date](#startdate)
- [Status](#status)
- [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone)
- [Version](#version)

You can download all fields of the *Image Ad Extension* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ImageAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Image Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Alternative Text,Media Ids
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,
Image Ad Extension,Active,-14,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,,,,,FALSE,ImageAdExtension Alternative Text,ImageMediaIdHere
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkImageAdExtension* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkImageAdExtension
var bulkImageAdExtension = new BulkImageAdExtension
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AccountId = 0,
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // ImageAdExtension object of the Campaign Management service.
    ImageAdExtension = new ImageAdExtension
    {
        // 'Alternative Text' column header in the Bulk file
        AlternativeText = "ImageAdExtension Alternative Text",
        // 'Destination Url' column header in the Bulk file
        DestinationUrl = null,
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = imageAdExtensionIdKey,
        // 'Media Ids' column header in the Bulk file
        ImageMediaIds = new long[] { ImageMediaIdHere },
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdExtensionStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkImageAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

### <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
This field is not supported for image ad extensions. Scheduling is supported for other ad extension types.

### <a name="alternativetext"></a>Alternative Text
Alternative description of the image media for usability. If the image could not be displayed, the alternative text is used instead.

The maximum length for this element is 35 characters.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Required    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="destinationurl"></a>Destination URL
The URL of the webpage to take the user to when they click the image.

The URL can contain dynamic text strings such as {keyword}. For more information, see [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).

The URL can contain a maximum of 1,024 characters. If the URL does not specify a protocol, the system uses the HTTP protocol when a user clicks the ad. If the URL specifies the HTTP protocol when you add an ad, the service will remove the *http://* protocol string (the HTTP protocol string does not count against the 1,024 character limit); however, the service will not remove an HTTPS protocol string (https://) from the URL.

> [!NOTE]
> If the URL is not specified for the image ad extension, the URL of the ad is used.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Required    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="editoriallocation"></a>Editorial Location
The component or property of the ad extension that failed editorial review. 

**Add:** Read-only

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="editorialstatus"></a>Editorial Status

### <a name="enddate"></a>End Date
This field is not supported for image ad extensions. Scheduling is supported for other ad extension types.

### <a name="id"></a>Id
The system generated identifier of the ad extension.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the ad extension can then be referenced in the *Id* field of dependent record types such as [Ad Group Image Ad Extension](ad-group-image-ad-extension.md) and [Campaign Image Ad Extension](campaign-image-ad-extension.md). This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

### <a name="mediaids"></a>Media Ids
The identifiers of the images to include in the ad. You may not specify media identifiers for more than one image of the same aspect ratio. In other words each of  the referenced images must have different aspect ratios.

You can specify up to four (4) image media  identifiers. While the minimum required is one image media ID, in order to qualify for all native ad placements you must provide four image media identifiers, where each ID corresponds to an [Image](../campaign-management-service/image.md) of one of the four supported [Media](../campaign-management-service/media.md) types (aspect ratios). The supported aspect ratios for native ads are 16:9, 1.5:1, 4:3, and 1.2:1. For more information see the [Image](../campaign-management-service/image.md) data object reference documentation.

You can get the identifier of each [Image](../campaign-management-service/image.md) when you add them to the image library by calling the [AddMedia](../campaign-management-service/addmedia.md) operation. Otherwise after the media has been added to your image library you can get the media identifiers with the [GetMediaMetaDataByAccountId](../campaign-management-service/getmediametadatabyaccountid.md) operation.

In a bulk file, the list of media identifiers are delimited with a semicolon (;).

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

### <a name="usesearchertimezone"></a>Use Searcher Time Zone
