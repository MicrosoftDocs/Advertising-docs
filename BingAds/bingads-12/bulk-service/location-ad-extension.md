# Location Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a location ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

You can associate a location ad extension with the account or with campaigns in the account. Each entity (account or campaign) can be associated with as many location ad extensions as you decide, up to the total number of location ad extensions in your account. Use the [Account Location Ad Extension](account-location-ad-extension.md) and [Campaign Location Ad Extension](campaign-location-ad-extension.md) records to manage location ad extension associations.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Location Ad Extension* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Schedule](#adschedule)
- [Address Line 1](#addressline1)
- [Address Line 2](#addressline2)
- [Business Name](#businessname)
- [City](#city)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Country Code](#countrycode)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [End Date](#enddate)
- [Geo Code Status](#geocodestatus)
- [Id](#id)
- [Latitude](#latitude)
- [Longitude](#longitude)
- [Map Icon](#mapicon)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Phone Number](#phonenumber)
- [Postal Code](#postalcode)
- [Province Name](#provincename)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Start Date](#startdate)
- [State Or Province Code](#stateorprovincecode)
- [Status](#status)
- [Use Searcher Time Zone](#usesearchertimezone)
- [Version](#version)

You can download all fields of the *Location Ad Extension* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *LocationAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Location Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Business Name,Phone Number,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Address Line 1,Address Line 2,Postal Code,City,State Or Province Code,Province Name,Latitude,Longitude,Country Code
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,
Location Ad Extension,Active,-15,0,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,,12/31/2018,Contoso Shoes,206-555-0100,,,(Monday[09:00-21:00]),FALSE,1234 Washington Place,Suite 1210,98608,Woodinville,,WA,0,0,US
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkLocationAdExtension* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

```

### <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. If you do not set this field, then the existing settings will be retained. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively removing all existing day and time ranges.

### <a name="latitude"></a>Latitude

If you specify the known coordinates, the service does not confirm whether the specified coordinates match the specified business address. If you do not provide the coordinates, the Bulk service uses the businesses’ address to determine the coordinates.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding more than 10 location ad extensions, the service resolves coordinates offline, and otherwise resolves coordinates up front during execution of the service operation. The location will not be used in an ad until the coordinates are determined, which can take from seconds to minutes depending on the number of location ad extensions being added and the current demand.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.
