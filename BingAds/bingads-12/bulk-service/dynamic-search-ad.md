# Dynamic Search Ad Record - Bulk
Defines a dynamic search ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

With a dynamic search ads campaign, the ad title and display URL are generated automatically based on the website domain and language that you want to target.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently available in Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.   

You can download all *Dynamic Search Ad* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *DynamicSearchAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new dynamic search ad if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,
Dynamic Search Ad,Active,,-1113,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameGoesHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,Find New Customers & Increase Sales! Start Advertising on Contoso Today.,,,,,,,,,,,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,,,seattle,shoe sale
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkDynamicSearchAd* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkDynamicSearchAd
var bulkDynamicSearchAd = new BulkDynamicSearchAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameGoesHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // DynamicSearchAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    DynamicSearchAd = new DynamicSearchAd
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Path 1' column header in the Bulk file
        Path1 = "seattle",
        // 'Path 2' column header in the Bulk file
        Path2 = "shoe sale",
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales! Start Advertising on Contoso Today.",
        // 'Tracking Template' column header in the Bulk file
        TrackingUrlTemplate = null,
        // 'Custom Parameter' column header in the Bulk file
        UrlCustomParameters = new CustomParameters
        {
            // Each custom parameter is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            Parameters = new[] {
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "promoCode",
                    Value = "PROMO1"
                },
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "season",
                    Value = "summer"
                },
            }
        },
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkDynamicSearchAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the [Parent Id](#parentid) or [Ad Group](#adgroup) field.

## <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the ad group and ad.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Bing Ads will accept the first 3 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and any additional custom parameters will be ignored. For customers in the Custom Parameters Limit Increase Phase 2 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 565), Bing Ads will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. During calendar year 2019 the limit will be increased from 3 to 8 for all customers. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 200 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only

**Add:** Read-only and Required. You must either specify an existing ad group identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new ads to a new ad group in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only

## <a name="path1"></a>Path 1
The first part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The display URL e.g. *www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your display URL. Then if you have specified a value for *Path 1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path 2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path 1*. For example if your domain is *contoso.com*, *Path 1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path 2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.

The maximum input length of the path is 15 characters. Note that for languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the path is 7 characters. Although dynamic text substitution is supported for other ad types like Expanded Text ads, it is not supported for dynamic search ads.

The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters.

If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="path2"></a>Path 2
The second part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The display URL e.g. *www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your dynamic search ads campaign level settings. Then if you have specified a value for *Path 1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path 2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path 1*. For example if your domain is *contoso.com*, *Path 1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path 2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.

You can only specify *Path 2* if *Path 1* is also set.

The maximum input length of the path is 15 characters. Note that for languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the path is 7 characters. Although dynamic text substitution is supported for other ad types like Expanded Text ads, it is not supported for dynamic search ads.

The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters. If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="publishercountries"></a>Publisher Countries
The list of publisher countries whose editorial guidelines do not allow the specified [term](#editorialterm).

In a bulk file, the list of publisher countries are delimited with a semicolon (;).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="status"></a>Status
The status of the ad.

Possible values are *Active*, *Paused*, or *Deleted*. 

**Add:** Optional. The default value is *Active*.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Required. The Status must be set to *Deleted*.

## <a name="text"></a>Text
The ad copy.

The text must contain at least one word.

The maximum input length of the copy is 90 characters. Note that for ad groups that use Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the copy is 45 characters. Although dynamic text substitution is supported for other ad types like expanded text ads, it is not supported for dynamic search ads.

The text cannot contain the newline (\n) character.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for the URL specified with FinalUrls.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Bing Ads does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.   
**Delete:** Read-only
