# Product Ad Record - Bulk
Defines a product ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

A product ad is not used directly for delivered ad copy.  Instead, the delivery engine generates product ads from the product details that it finds in the customerâ€™s Bing Merchant Center store catalog.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Product Ad* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Editorial Appeal Status](#editorialappealstatus)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Promotion](#promotion)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Status](#status)

You can download all fields of the *Product Ad* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ProductAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new product ad given a valid ad group ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,
Product Ad,Active,,-1112,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,,,,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkProductAd* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkProductAd
var bulkProductAd = new BulkProductAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // ProductAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    ProductAd = new ProductAd
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Promotion' column header in the Bulk file
        PromotionalText = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales!",
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkProductAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
