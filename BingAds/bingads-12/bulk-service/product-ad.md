# Product Ad Record - Bulk
Defines a product ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

A product ad is not used directly for delivered ad copy.  Instead, the delivery engine generates product ads from the product details that it finds in the customer’s Bing Merchant Center store catalog.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Product Ad* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Editorial Appeal Status](#editorialappealstatus)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Promotion](#promotion)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Status](#status)

You can download all fields of the *Product Ad* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ProductAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new product ad given a valid ad group ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,
Product Ad,Active,,-1112,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,,,,,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkProductAd* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkProductAd
var bulkProductAd = new BulkProductAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // ProductAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    ProductAd = new ProductAd
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Promotion' column header in the Bulk file
        PromotionalText = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales!",
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkProductAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

## <a name="entityperformancedata"></a>Performance Data Fields in the Bulk File
If the [DataScope Value Set](datascope.md) element of the download request includes *EntityPerformanceData*, the download file will also include the following fields in this record.

|Column Header|Description|
|-----------------|---------------|
|*Spend*|The cost per click (CPC) summed for each click.|
|*Impressions*|The number of times an ad has been displayed on search results pages. Without impressions there are no clicks or conversions.|
|*Clicks*|The number of times that the ads in the account were clicked.|
|*CTR*|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%).<br/><br/>The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) * 100*.|
|*Avg CPC*|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16.<br/><br/>The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|*Avg CPM*|The average of the cost-per-thousand impressions of the ads.<br/><br/>The value will be 0 (zero) if the corresponding ad groups do not specify the Content ad distribution medium.|
|*Avg position*|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|*Conversions*|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|*CPA*|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*.<br/><br/>Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|
