# Sitelink Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines a sitelink ad extension that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

You can associate a sitelink ad extension with the account or with campaigns and ad groups in the account. Each entity (account, campaign, or ad group) can be associated with up to 20 sitelink ad extensions. Use the [Account Sitelink Ad Extension](account-sitelink-ad-extension.md), [Ad Group Sitelink Ad Extension](ad-group-sitelink-ad-extension.md), and [Campaign Sitelink Ad Extension](campaign-sitelink-ad-extension.md) records to manage sitelink ad extension associations.

You can download all *Sitelink Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *SitelinkAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new Sitelink Ad Extension to the account's shared library. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Start Date,End Date,Device Preference,Name,Ad Schedule,Use Searcher Time Zone,Sitelink Extension Order,Sitelink Extension Link Text,Sitelink Extension Destination Url,Sitelink Extension Description1,Sitelink Extension Description2,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Final Url Suffix,Custom Parameter

```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkSitelinkAdExtension* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

## <a name="adschedule"></a>Ad Schedule
The list of day and time ranges that you want the ad extension to be displayed with your ads. Each day and time range includes the scheduled day of week, start/end hour, and start/end minute. Each day and time range is enclosed by left and right parentheses, and separated from other day and time ranges with a semicolon (;) delimiter. Within each day and time range the format is *Day[StartHour:StartMinue-EndHour:EndMinute]*.

The possible values of *StartHour* range from 00 to 23, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *EndHour* range from 00 to 24, where *00* is equivalent to 12:00AM and *12* is 12:00PM.

The possible values of *StartMinute* and *EndMinute* range from 00 to 60.

The following example demonstrates day and time ranges during weekdays from 9:00AM through 9:00PM: *(Monday[09:00-21:00]);(Tuesday[09:00-21:00]);(Wednesday[09:00-21:00]);(Thursday[09:00-21:00]);(Friday[09:00-21:00])*

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, then ad extensions will be eligible for scheduling anytime during the calendar start and end dates.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. The individual day and time ranges cannot be updated. You can effectively update the day and time ranges by sending a new set that should replace the prior set. If you do not set this field, then the existing settings will be retained. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively removing all existing day and time ranges.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

- Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

- Bing Ads will accept the first 3 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and any additional custom parameters will be ignored. For customers in the Custom Parameters Limit Increase Phase 2 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 565), Bing Ads will accept the first 8 custom parameter key and value pairs that you include, and if you include more than 8 custom parameters an error will be returned. During calendar year 2019 the limit will be increased from 3 to 8 for all customers. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.

- A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

- The Key cannot exceed 16 UTF-8 bytes, and the Value cannot exceed 200 UTF-8 bytes. The Key is required and the Value is optional. The maximum size of the Key does not include the braces and underscore i.e., '{', '_', and '}'. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > With the Bulk service the Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}. With the Campaign Management service you cannot specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="devicepreference"></a>Device Preference
This field determines whether the preference is for the ad extension to be displayed on mobile devices or all devices.

Possible values are *All* and *Mobile*, which differ from values used in the campaign management service. 

The default value is *All*.

In the bulk download and upload results file, this field will never be empty. If you did not specify a device preference, the default value of *All* will be returned.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *All*.    
**Delete:** Read-only

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="enddate"></a>End Date
The ad extension scheduled end date string formatted as *MM/DD/YYYY*.

The end date is inclusive. For example, if you set this field to 12/31/2019, the ad extensions will stop being shown at 11:59 PM on 12/31/2019.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify an end date, the ad extensions will continue to be delivered unless you pause the associated campaigns, ad groups, or ads.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. The end date can be shortened or extended, as long as the start date is either null or occurs before the new end date. If you do not set this field, then the existing settings will be retained. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively removing the end date and the ad extensions will continue to be delivered unless you pause the associated campaigns, ad groups, or ads.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurl"></a>Final Url
The landing page URL to use with optional tracking template and custom parameters.

The following validation rules apply to Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs.

- The length of the URL is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- You may specify up to 10 items for both Final URLs and Final Mobile URLs; however, only the first item in each list is used for delivery. The service allows up to 10 for potential forward compatibility.

- Each URL is delimited by a semicolon and space ("; ").

- Usage of '{' and '}' is only allowed to delineate tags, for example "{lpurl}".

- Each URL must be a well-formed URL starting with either http:// or https://.

**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="finalurlsuffix"></a>Final Url Suffix
The final URL suffix can include tracking parameters that will be appended to the end of your landing page URL. We recommend placing tracking parameters that your landing page requires in a final URL suffix so that your customers are always sent to your landing page. For more details and validation rules see [Final URL Suffix](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md#finalurlsuffixvalidation) in the technical guides. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available for customers in the Final URL Suffix Phase 2 pilot ([GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) returns 566). If you are not in the pilot this property will be ignored and no error will be returned. During calendar year 2019 this feature will be enabled for all customers.  

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="id"></a>Id
The system generated identifier of the ad extension.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier.

This is recommended if you are adding new ad extensions and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required

The URL can contain a maximum of 1,024 characters. If the URL does not specify a protocol, the system uses the HTTP protocol when a user clicks the ad. If the URL specifies the HTTP protocol when you add an ad, the service will remove the http:// protocol string (the HTTP protocol string does not count against the 1,024 character limit); however, the service will not remove an HTTPS protocol string (https://) from the URL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are currently using Destination URLs, you must eventually replace them with Final URLs. For more information, see [URL Tracking with Upgraded URLs](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md).

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify a start date, the ad extensions are immediately eligible to be scheduled during the day and time ranges.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. The start date can be shortened or extended, as long as the end date is either null or occurs after the new start date. If you do not set this field, then the existing settings will be retained.

## <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use for your sitelink URLs.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Bing Ads does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="usesearchertimezone"></a>Use Searcher Time Zone
Determines whether to use the account time zone or the time zone of the search user where the ads could be delivered.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and the account time zone will be used.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is set for the update, this setting is not changed. If you set this field to the *delete_value* string, the prior setting is removed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *FALSE*.   
**Delete:** Read-only  

## <a name="version"></a>Version
The number of times the contents of the ad extension has been updated. The version is set to 1 when you add the extension and is incremented each time it’s revised.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only
