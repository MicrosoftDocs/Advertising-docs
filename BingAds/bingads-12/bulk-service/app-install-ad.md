# App Install Ad Record - Bulk
Defines an app install ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file. Create an app install ad if your intention is to drive app downloads, and not necessarily to direct leads to a web site. If you want to direct leads to a web site in addition to driving app downloads, then you should create a text ad with app ad extensions.

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.
>
> Before you can use app install ads, you must upgrade to Final Urls. For more information, see [URL Tracking with Upgraded URLs](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md).
>
> Bing Ads only supports *EN-US* apps.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For an *App Install Ad* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [App Id](#appid)
- [App Platform](#appplatform)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Custom Parameter](#customparameter)
- [Device Preference](#devicepreference)
- [Editorial Appeal Status](#editorialappealstatus)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [Final Url](#finalurl)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Status](#status)
- [Text](#text)
- [Title](#title)
- [Tracking Template](#trackingtemplate)

You can download all fields of the *App Install Ad* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AppInstallAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new app install ad given a valid ad group ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,
App Install Ad,Active,,-1111,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,Contoso Quick Setup,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,,,,All,,Android,AppStoreIdGoesHere,FinalUrlGoesHere,,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkAppInstallAd* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAppInstallAd
var bulkAppInstallAd = new BulkAppInstallAd
{
    // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file
    AdGroupName = "AdGroupNameHere",
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file
    CampaignName = "ParentCampaignNameGoesHere",
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
                
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // AppInstallAd object of the Campaign Management service.
    AppInstallAd = new AppInstallAd
    {
        // 'App Platform' column header in the Bulk file
        AppPlatform = "Android",
        // 'App Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AppStoreId = "AppStoreIdGoesHere",
        // 'Device Preference' column header in the Bulk file
        DevicePreference = 0,
        // 'Final Url' column header in the Bulk file
        FinalUrls = new[] {
            // Each Url is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            "FinalUrlGoesHere"
        },
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,
        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdStatus.Active,
        // 'Text' column header in the Bulk file
        Text = "Find New Customers & Increase Sales!",
        // 'Title' column header in the Bulk file
        Title = "Contoso Quick Setup",
        // 'Tracking Template' column header in the Bulk file
        TrackingUrlTemplate = null,
        // 'Custom Parameter' column header in the Bulk file
        UrlCustomParameters = new CustomParameters
        {
            // Each custom parameter is delimited by a semicolon (;) in the Bulk file
            Parameters = new[] {
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "promoCode",
                    Value = "PROMO1"
                },
                new CustomParameter(){
                    Key = "season",
                    Value = "summer"
                },
            }
        },
    },
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAppInstallAd);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

The application identifier provided by the app store.

If the application is new, please expect to wait 4-7 days before the ad will be eligible to deliver.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

-   Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

-   You may include up to 3 custom parameter key and value pairs. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.

-   A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

-   The Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}.

    **Note:** With the Bulk service the surrounding braces and underscore are required. The maximum length of 16 UTF-8 bytes does not include the braces and underscore: '{', '_', and '}'. With the Campaign Management service the maximum length is 16 UTF-bytes, and you may not specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only

The default value is *All*.

In the bulk download and upload results file, this field will never be empty. If you did not specify a device preference, the default value of *All* will be returned.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *All*.

### <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for the URL specified with FinalUrls.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Bing Ads does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example if your tracking template is for example *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional
