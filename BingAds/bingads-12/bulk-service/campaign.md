You can download all fields of the *Campaign* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *Campaigns* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add one campaign of each type i.e. Search and Content, Shopping, and Dynamic Search Ads campaign. 

```csv

```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkCampaign* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file.

### <a name="bidadjustment"></a>Bid Adjustment
The percent amount by which to adjust your bid for native ads above or below the base ad group or keyword bid.

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.

Supported values are negative one hundred (-100) through positive nine hundred (900). Setting the bid adjustment to -100 percent will prevent native ads from showing for this campaign.

Set this field to zero (0) if you do not want any bid adjustment for native ads.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field the system default bid adjustment will be used. The system default bid adjustment is currently zero (0), and is subject to change.   
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. If you set this field to *delete_value* the system default bid adjustment will be used. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. The system default bid adjustment is currently zero (0), and is subject to change. If you do not specify any value this field will be ignored.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="bidstrategymaxcpc"></a>Bid Strategy MaxCpc
The maximum cost per click that you want to spend with the corresponding bid strategy type. 

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.
> 
> The *Bid Strategy MaxCpc* field is only used if the *Bid Strategy Type* field is set to *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, or *TargetCpa*, and otherwise this field is ignored.
> 
> The *MaxClicks* bid strategy is available only to advertisers from the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.
> 
> The *MaxConversions* bid strategy is available only to advertisers from the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States.
> 
> The *TargetCpa* bid strategy is available only to advertisers from the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="bidstrategytargetcpa"></a>Bid Strategy TargetCpa
The target cost per acquisition (CPA) that you want used by Bing Ads to maximize conversions. 

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.
> 
> The *Bid Strategy TargetCpa* field is only used if the *Bid Strategy Type* field is set to *TargetCpa*, and otherwise this field is ignored.
> 
> The *TargetCpa* bid strategy is available only to advertisers from the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States.

**Add:** Required if the *Bid Strategy Type* field is set to *TargetCpa*, and otherwise this field is ignored.   
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="bidstrategytype"></a>Bid Strategy Type
The bid strategy type for how you want to manage your bids. 

A bid strategy type set at the [Ad Group](ad-group.md) or [Keyword](keyword.md) level will take precedence over the campaign level bid strategy type. 

For campaigns you can use any of the following bid strategy types. 
*  *EnhancedCpc* - Use the enhanced CPC bid strategy type to set your ad group and keyword bids, and Bing Ads will automatically adjust your bids in real time so that you bid up to 30% higher on users that are more likely to convert and up to 100% less on users less likely to convert. Bing Ads will still respect your campaign budget limit.  
*  *ManualCpc* - This is the default bid strategy type for your campaigns. Use the manual CPC bid strategy type if you will set your [Ad Group](ad-group.md) or [Keyword](keyword.md) bids, and Bing Ads will use these bids every time.  

If you are signed up to pilot one or more of the auto bid strategy types, then you can also use the corresponding bid strategy type value:  

*  *MaxClicks* - Defines an automated bidding strategy to maximize clicks given your maximum allowed budget.  
*  *MaxConversions* - Defines an automated bidding strategy to maximize conversions given your maximum allowed budget.    
*  *TargetCpa* - Defines an automated bidding strategy to maximize conversions at the target cost per acquisition (CPA). If you use this strategy type then you must also include the *Bid Strategy TargetCpa* field.    

For campaigns of type *Shopping* only the *EnhancedCpc* or *ManualCpc* bid strategy values can be used, and you must be in the Bing Shopping Enhanced CPC pilot. The pilot ID is 340.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, and *TargetCpa* bid strategy types are available in several markets (For more details, see [Budget and Bid Strategies](../guides/budget-bid-strategies.md).)  If the campaign bid strategy type is set to *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, or *TargetCpa*, the behavior of existing features will change unless you set an individual ad group’s or keyword’s bid strategy to *ManualCpc*.  
> -  You can continue to set the ad group and keyword bids; however they will not be used by Bing Ads.
> -  Bing Ads will periodically change your stored ad group or keyword bid settings. You can continue to set new bids, however Bing Ads may change them at any time using this bid strategy type.
> -  You can continue to set bid adjustments e.g. for age, gender, or location; however, the multiplier will inform rather than directly modify or override the automated bid. For auto bidding the multiplier is used as a weighted percentage to inform Bing Ads about how much you value the criterion relative to other criteria. For example, a -50% bid multiplier for a mobile device criterion with the Max Conversions bid strategy to indicate that you value conversions from mobile traffic half as much as other device types. The same bid multiplier with the Max Clicks bid strategy would indicate that you value clicks on mobile half as much as other device types. The valid range of values that you can use to inform auto bidding is -100.00 through 30.00.
> -  Whether you chose the *DailyBudgetAccelerated* or *DailyBudgetStandard* budget type, Bing Ads will use the *DailyBudgetStandard* budget type. 
> 
> Also note that you must have conversion tracking (a UET tag and a conversion goal) set up for the *EnhancedCpc*, *MaxConversions*, and *TargetCpa* bid strategy types to work. See [Universal Event Tracking](../guides/universal-event-tracking.md) for more information.
> 
> To set the *MaxConversions* or *TargetCpa* bid strategy types, the campaign must have at least 15 conversions in the last 30 days. If you try to add or update a campaign to use one of these strategy types, the requested operation will fail if there is not enough conversion history. If an active campaign uses one of these bid strategy types, and then ceases to meet the minimum conversion history requirement at any time, Bing Ads will stop auto bidding but will continue to use the *DailyBudgetStandard* budget type. For a new campaign we recommend that you start with *EnhancedCpc* and then when the campaign has enough conversion history, you can update it to use either the *MaxConversions* or *TargetCpa* bid strategy.

> [!TIP]
> You can set your campaign’s bid strategy to *EnhancedCpc*, *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, or *TargetCpa* and then, at any time, set an individual ad group’s or keyword’s bid strategy to *ManualCpc*.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field, then *ManualCpc* is used by default.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.  If you update the bid strategy type, then any existing values in the *Bid Strategy MaxCpc* and *Bid Strategy TargetCpa* fields will be deleted.       
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="budget"></a>Budget
The campaign's budget amount.

In the context of shared budgets, the budget amount is a read-only property that is always returned regardless of whether or not the campaign uses a shared budget. When a campaign is associated to a shared budget the amount returned is that of the shared budget. To determine whether the campaign uses a shared budget, check the value of the *Budget Id* field.

*Shared budget:*  
**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Not allowed. If you try to update the budget amount of a campaign that has a shared budget, the service will return the *CampaignServiceCannotUpdateSharedBudget* error code.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

*Unshared budget:*  
**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="budgetid"></a>Budget Id
The system generated identifier of the [Budget](budget.md) that this campaign shares with other campaigns in the account.

If the field is empty, then the campaign is not using a shared budget. If the field is not empty and the value is greater than zero, then the campaign is using a shared budget. If the campaign is using a shared budget, and you prefer that it use its own budget amount, set this element to '0' (zero) and set the *Budget* field to a valid budget amount.

> [!NOTE]
> This value corresponds to the *Id* column of the [Budget](budget.md) record.
	
**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="budgetname"></a>Budget Name

The type of the campaign.

The campaign type determines whether the campaign is a Bing Shopping campaign, Dynamic Search Ads campaign, or Search &amp; Content campaign. Possible values include *Shopping*, *DynamicSearchAds*, and *SearchAndContent*.

**Add:** Optional. If not specified, then default value of *SearchAndContent* is used and you cannot set Bing Shopping or Dynamic Search Ads campaign settings.  If the campaign type is *Shopping* then you must also include the *Country Code*, *Priority*, and *Store Id* fields. If the campaign type is *DynamicSearchAds* then you must also include the *Domain Language* and *Website* fields.

-   Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

-   You may include up to 3 custom parameter key and value pairs. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.

-   A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

-   The Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}.

    **Note:** With the Bulk service the surrounding braces and underscore are required. The maximum length of 16 UTF-8 bytes does not include the braces and underscore: '{', '_', and '}'. With the Campaign Management service the maximum length is 16 UTF-bytes, and you may not specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  


### <a name="domainlanguage"></a>Domain Language
The language of the website pages that you want to target for dynamic search ads.

Currently the only supported language code is *EN*.

**Update:** Read-only. You cannot update the language.      
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="id"></a>Id
The system generated identifier of the campaign.

**Add:** Optional. You must either leave this field empty, or specify a negative identifier. A negative identifier set for the campaign can then be referenced in the *Parent Id* field of dependent record types such as ad groups or criterion. This is recommended if you are adding new campaigns and new dependent records in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For update and delete, you must specify either the *Id* or *Campaign* field.

### <a name="language"></a>Language
Your ad language setting determines the language you will use when you write your ads and should be the language of your customers.  

For possible values, see the Language column of [Ad Languages](../guides/ad-languages.md#adlanguage). Each language in the bulk field is delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example *English; French; German*. You can specify multiple languages individually in the list, or only include one string in this field set to *All* if you want to target all languages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for multiple languages at the campaign level is in pilot. If languages are set at both the ad group and campaign level, the ad group-level language will override the campaign-level language. The customer is enabled for the pilot if the [GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) response includes pilot number *310*. Pilot participants will be able to set multiple languages at the campaign level, and will be able to delete the ad group level language. If your application depends on ad group language being set, then you must prepare for the possibility that ad group language will be nil. Also note that as a one time migration when the customer is added to pilot, campaign languages are set to the union of all individual ad group languages. For example if you have three ad groups with language set to *English*, *German*, and *French*, then at the time of pilot enablement this campaign's languages will be set to a list including *English*, *German*, and *French*. 

**Add:** Optional. If there is no campaign language set, then the language of each ad group within the campaign will be required.   
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. Once campaign languages are set, you cannot delete all of them. The list of languages that you specify during update replaces the previous settings i.e. does not append to the existing set of languages.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="localinventoryadsenabled"></a>LocalInventoryAdsEnabled
Determines whether local inventory ads are enabled for the Bing Merchant Center store.

Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don’t, don’t worry. It’s coming soon.

Set this property to *TRUE* if you want to enable local inventory ads, and otherwise set it to *FALSE*.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not specify this field or leave it empty, the default value of *FALSE* will be set and local inventory ads will not be enabled.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only

**Delete:** Read-only and Required  
  
### <a name="priority"></a>Priority
Helps determine which Bing Shopping campaign serves ads, in the event that two or more campaigns use the product catalog feed from the same Bing Merchant Center store.

You must specify one of the supported values: 0, 1, or 2. The higher numbers are given higher priority.

If two shopping campaigns use the product catalog feed from same Bing Merchant Center store, then  ads will be delivered for the [Ad Group Product Partition](ad-group-product-partition.md) with the highest bid.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a Bing Shopping campaign in the Bing Ads web application, the default priority selected is "Low" which is the equivalent of '0'.

**Add:** Required if the *Campaign Type* field is set to *Shopping*. You cannot include this column for other campaign types.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="status"></a>Status

### <a name="trackingtemplate"></a>Tracking Template
The tracking template to use as a default for all URLs in your campaign.

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Bing Ads does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example if your tracking template is for example *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

## <a name="entityperformancedata"></a>Performance Data Fields in the Bulk File
If the [DataScope Value Set](datascope.md) element of the download request includes *EntityPerformanceData*, the download file will also include the following fields in this record.

|Column Header|Description|
|-----------------|---------------|
|*Spend*|The cost per click (CPC) summed for each click.|
|*Impressions*|The number of times an ad has been displayed on search results pages. Without impressions there are no clicks or conversions.|
|*Clicks*|The number of times that the ads in the account were clicked.|
|*CTR*|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%).<br/><br/>The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) * 100*.|
|*Avg CPC*|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16.<br/><br/>The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|*Avg CPM*|The average of the cost-per-thousand impressions of the ads.<br/><br/>The value will be 0 (zero) if the corresponding ad groups do not specify the Content ad distribution medium.|
|*Avg position*|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|*Conversions*|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|*CPA*|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*.<br/><br/>Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|

## <a name="qualityscore"></a>Quality Score Fields in the Bulk File
If the [DataScope Value Set](datascope.md) element of the download request includes *QualityScore*, the download file will also include the following fields in this record.

|Column Header|Description|
|-----------------|---------------|
|*Quality Score*|The numeric score shows you how competitive your ads are in the marketplace by measuring how relevant your keywords and landing pages are to customers' search terms. The quality score is calculated by Bing Ads using the *Keyword Relevance*, *Landing Page Relevance*, and *Landing Page User Experience* sub scores. If available, the quality score can range from a low of 1 to a high of 10.<br/><br/>Quality score is based on the last rolling 30 days for the owned and operated search traffic. A quality score can be assigned without any impressions, in the case where a keyword bid did not win any auctions. Traffic for content and syndicated networks do not affect quality score. The value in the report will be blank if the score was not computed. This can occur if there have been no impressions for the keyword for 30 days or more.<br/><br/>Quality score is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends. Keywords in all time zones will be assigned a quality score for the corresponding UTC day.<br/><br/>If you run the report multiple times in a day, the quality score values could change from report to report based on when you run the report relative to when the scores are calculated.<br/><br/>If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the quality score is the current and most recently calculated score and will be reported as the same for each day in the time period. Use the historic quality score to find out how quality score may have changed over time. Historical quality score is a daily snapshot of the rolling quality score. For more information on historic quality score, see the *HistoricQualityScore* column in [Report Attributes and Performance Statistics](../guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md).|
|*Keyword Relevance*|A numeric score that indicates how likely your ads will be clicked and how well your keyword competes against other keywords targeting the same traffic. This score predicts whether your keyword is likely to lead to a click on your ads, taking into account how well your keyword has performed in the past relative to your ad's position.<br/><br/>*Keyword Relevance* is equivalent to the **Expected Click-Through Rate** label used in the Bing Ads web application.<br/><br/>A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.<br/><br/>If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score.<br/><br/>Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
