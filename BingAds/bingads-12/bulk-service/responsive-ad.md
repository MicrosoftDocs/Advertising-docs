# Responsive Ad Record - Bulk

> [!NOTE]
> Not everyone is enabled for Audience campaigns in the Microsoft Audience Network yet. If you don't, don't worry. It's coming soon. 

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For an *Responsive Ad* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Business Name](#businessname)
- [Call To Action](#calltoaction)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Custom Parameter](#customparameter)
- [Editorial Appeal Status](#editorialappealstatus)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [Final Url](#finalurl)
- [Headline](#headline)
- [Id](#id)
- [Landscape Image Media Id](#landscapeimagemediaid)
- [Landscape Logo Media Id](#landscapelogomediaid)
- [Long Headline](#longheadline)
- [Mobile Final Url](#mobilefinalurl)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)

- [Status](#status)
- [Square Image Media Id](#squareimagemediaid)

You can download all fields of the *Responsive Ad* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *ResponsiveAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new responsive ad given a valid ad group ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Sync Time,Client Id,Modified Time,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Text,Business Name,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,Call To Action,Headline,Long Headline,Landscape Image Media Id,Square Image Media Id,Landscape Logo Media Id,Square Logo Media Id

```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkResponsiveAd* class (coming soon), instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)

- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).

- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.

- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. 

- Bing Ads does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example, if your tracking template is *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.    
**Delete:** Read-only
