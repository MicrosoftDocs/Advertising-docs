# Campaign Action Ad Extension Record - Bulk
Defines an association record between a [Campaign](campaign.md) and an [Action Ad Extension](action-ad-extension.md) that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file. To upload or download the campaign or action ad extension, use the [Campaign](campaign.md) or [Action Ad Extension](action-ad-extension.md) record.

You can download all *Campaign Action Ad Extension* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CampaignActionAdExtensions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would associate an action ad extension to a campaign if valid [Id](#id) and [Parent Id](#parentid) values are provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Name
Format Version,,,,,,,,6
Campaign Action Ad Extension,Active,-11,-1111,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkCampaignActionAdExtension* class (coming soon), instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCampaignActionAdExtension
var bulkCampaignActionAdExtension = new BulkCampaignActionAdExtension
{
    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // AdExtensionIdToEntityIdAssociation object of the Campaign Management service.
    AdExtensionIdToEntityIdAssociation = new AdExtensionIdToEntityIdAssociation
    {
        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AdExtensionId = actionAdExtensionIdKey,
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        EntityId = campaignIdKey,
    },
                
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",
    // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
    Status = Status.Active,
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCampaignActionAdExtension);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
