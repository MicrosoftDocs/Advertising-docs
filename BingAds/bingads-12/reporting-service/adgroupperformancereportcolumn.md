# AdGroupPerformanceReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AdGroupPerformanceReportRequest](adgroupperformancereportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).

|<a name="adrelevance"></a>AdRelevance|How closely related your ads is to the customer's search query or other input. It tells you how relevant your ad and landing page are to potential customers.A score of 3 is Above Average; a score of 2 is Average; and a score of 1 is considered Below Average.If you specify a time period that spans multiple days, the score will be the same for each day in the time period, and the value is the most recent calculated score. Data for this column is typically updated 14-18 hours after the UTC day ends.|
|<a name="assists"></a>Assists|The number of conversions from other ads within the same account that were preceded by one or more clicks from this ad.An ad is considered to have assisted the conversion if it was clicked before the most recently clicked ad that was credited with the conversion. Additionally, the click corresponding to the assist must occur  within the conversion period of the goal.|
|<a name="averagecpc"></a>AverageCpc|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked.

|<a name="conversions"></a>Conversions|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad.
