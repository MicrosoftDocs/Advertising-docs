# Reporting Service Reference
The Reporting [service](~/guides/web-service-addresses.md) defines an Application Programming Interface (API) that you can use to request and download reports.

|Interface|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[Reporting Service Operations](reporting-service-operations.md)|Use the [SubmitGenerateReport](submitgeneratereport.md) and [PollGenerateReport](pollgeneratereport.md) operations to specify the type of report that you want to download, and get the download URL. For an overview, see [Request and Download a Report](~/guides/request-download-report.md).|
|[Reporting Data Objects](reporting-data-objects.md)|You'll find most of the same reports that are available in the Bing Ads web application, for example the [CampaignPerformanceReportRequest](campaignperformancereportrequest.md) and [SearchCampaignChangeHistoryReportRequest](searchcampaignchangehistoryreportrequest.md).|
|[Reporting Value Sets](reporting-value-sets.md)|Use the reporting value sets to specify the [attributes and performance statistics](~/guides/report-attributes-performance-statistics.md) you want to download.|
