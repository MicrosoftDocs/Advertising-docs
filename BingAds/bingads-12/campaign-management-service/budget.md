# Budget Data Object - Campaign Management
Represents a budget that can be shared by any campaigns in an account.

You can set a single daily budget that can be used by any campaign within the same account. This will enable you to efficiently distribute a single daily budget across all campaigns or across a defined group of campaigns within your Bing Ads account. 

Say you have a budget of $20 to be used uniformly between two campaigns every day. On a given day Campaign A spends only $8 (of its $10 budget) because it got a smaller amount of impressions and clicks than usual. Using a Shared Budget, if Campaign B is performing well then Bing Ads will automatically take the remaining $2 and allocate it to Campaign B. This will increase the chances that the remaining budget will be used to send you more traffic.
