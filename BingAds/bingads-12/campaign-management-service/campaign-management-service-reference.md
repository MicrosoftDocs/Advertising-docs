# Campaign Management Service Reference
The Campaign Management [service](~/guides/web-service-addresses.md) defines an Application Programming Interface (API) that you can use to manage your advertising campaigns.

|Interface|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[Campaign Management Service Operations](campaign-management-service-operations.md)|Service operations such as [AddCampaigns](addcampaigns.md), [AddAds](addads.md) and [AddAdExtensions](addadextensions.md) can be used to add, get, update, and delete campaign data.|
|[Campaign Management Data Objects](campaign-management-data-objects.md)|You'll find most of the same entity settings that you are used to managing in the Bing Ads web application, for example [Campaign](campaign.md), [ExpandedTextAd](expandedtextad.md), and [LocationAdExtension](locationadextension.md).|
|[Campaign Management Value Sets](campaign-management-value-sets.md)|Value sets include [CampaignType](campaigntype.md), [AdType](adtype.md), and [AdExtensionsTypeFilter](adextensionstypefilter.md). You'll also find value sets for supported budget type, editorial status, and more.|
