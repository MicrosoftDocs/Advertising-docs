## <a name="elements"></a>Elements

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="adrotation"></a>AdRotation|Determines how often you'd like the ads in your ad group to show in relation to one another. If you have multiple ads within an ad group, your ads will rotate because no more than one ad from your account can show at a time.<br /><br /> This feature is not supported for ad groups in Bing Shopping campaigns.<br/><br/>Possible values are *OptimizeForClicks* and *RotateAdsEvenly*. <br/><br/>If set to *OptimizeForClicks*, Bing Ads will predominantly show ads that have the highest click-through rate (CTR).<br/><br/>If set to *RotateAdsEvenly*, Bing Ads will rotate between your ads on an equal basis. That is, each ad in a particular ad group has an equal chance of being displayed in response to a searcher's query. Sometimes the ads that get the highest CTR are not the ads that get the highest conversions. Using *RotateAdsEvenly*, you can help ensure that ads with a higher CTR don't unintentionally get precedence over ads with a higher conversion rate. Also if you want to test new ad copy, using *RotateAdsEvenly* can help ensure that those new ads get an opportunity to be displayed, even if you have other ads within the same ad group that have an established and higher CTR performance history.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The default value is *OptimizeForClicks*.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[AdRotation](adrotation.md)|
|<a name="biddingscheme"></a>BiddingScheme|The bid strategy type for how you want to manage your bids.<br/><br/>For ad groups you can use either of the [InheritFromParentBiddingScheme](inheritfromparentbiddingscheme.md) or [ManualCpcBiddingScheme](manualcpcbiddingscheme.md) objects.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** If the campaign bid strategy type is set to *MaxClicks*, *MaxConversions*, or *TargetCpa*, the behavior of existing features will change unless you set an individual ad group's or keyword's bid strategy to *ManualCpc*. <br/> -  You can continue to set the ad group and keyword bids; however they will not be used by Bing Ads.<br/> -  Bing Ads will periodically change your stored ad group or keyword bid settings. You can continue to set new bids, however Bing Ads may change them at any time using this bid strategy type.<br/> -  You can continue to set bid adjustments e.g. for age, gender, or location; however, the multiplier will inform rather than directly modify or override the automated bid. For auto bidding the multiplier is used as a weighted percentage to inform Bing Ads about how much you value the criterion relative to other criteria. For example, a -50% bid multiplier for a mobile device criterion with the Max Conversions bid strategy to indicate that you value conversions from mobile traffic half as much as other device types. The same bid multiplier with the Max Clicks bid strategy would indicate that you value clicks on mobile half as much as other device types. The valid range of values that you can use to inform auto bidding is -100.00 through 30.00.<br/> -  Whether you chose the *DailyBudgetAccelerated* or *DailyBudgetStandard* budget type, Bing Ads will use the *DailyBudgetStandard* budget type.<br/><br/>Also note that you must have conversion tracking (a UET tag and a conversion goal) set up for the *EnhancedCpc*, *MaxConversions*, and *TargetCpa* bid strategy types to work. See [Universal Event Tracking](../guides/universal-event-tracking.md) for more information.<br/><br/>To set the *MaxConversions* or *TargetCpa* bid strategy types, the campaign must have at least 15 conversions in the last 30 days. If you try to add or update a campaign to use one of these strategy types, the requested operation will fail if there is not enough conversion history. If an active campaign uses one of these bid strategy types, and then ceases to meet the minimum conversion history requirement at any time, Bing Ads will stop auto bidding but will continue to use the *DailyBudgetStandard* budget type. For a new campaign we recommend that you start with *EnhancedCpc* and then when the campaign has enough conversion history, you can update it to use either the *MaxConversions* or *TargetCpa* bid strategy.<br /><br />**Tip:** You can set your campaign's bid strategy to [EnhancedCpcBiddingScheme](enhancedcpcbiddingscheme.md), [MaxClicksBiddingScheme](maxclicksbiddingscheme.md), [MaxConversionsBiddingScheme](maxconversionsbiddingscheme.md), or [TargetCpaBiddingScheme](targetcpabiddingscheme.md) and then, at any time, set an individual ad group's or keyword's bid strategy to Manual CPC ([ManualCpcBiddingScheme](manualcpcbiddingscheme.md)).<br /><br /> For campaigns of type *Shopping* the product partitions inherit the ad group *BiddingScheme*, and you must be in the Bing Shopping Enhanced CPC pilot. The pilot ID is 340. <br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this element, then [InheritFromParentBiddingScheme](inheritfromparentbiddingscheme.md) is used by default.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[BiddingScheme](biddingscheme.md)|
|<a name="cpcbid"></a>CpcBid|The default bid to use when the user's query and the ad group's keywords match by using either a broad, exact, or phrase match comparison.<br/><br/>The minimum and maximum bid range depends on the account's currency. For more information, see [Currencies](../guides/currencies.md).<br /><br />Specifying a broad, exact, or phrase match bid at the keyword level overrides the ad group's Cpc bid value for the corresponding match type.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set a bid, it will be set to the minimum depending on your account's currency. <br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[Bid](bid.md)|
|<a name="enddate"></a>EndDate|The date that the ads in the ad group will expire.<br /><br />If you do not specify an end date, the ads will not expire. The end date can be extended to make an ad group's ads eligible for delivery, even after the ad group expires.<br /><br />The end date is inclusive. For example, if you set *EndDate* to 12/31/2020, the ads in the ad group will expire at 11:59 PM on 12/31/2020. The time is based on the time zone that you specify at the campaign level.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. To set no end date when adding an ad group, set the *EndDate* element to null.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. To delete the existing end date setting, and effectively set no end date when updating an ad group, set the *EndDate* element to a date equal to or later than January 2, 2050. When you retrieve the ad group next time, this element will be nil i.e. it will not be set to January 2, 2050.|[Date](date.md)|
|<a name="forwardcompatibilitymap"></a>ForwardCompatibilityMap|The list of key and value strings for forward compatibility to avoid otherwise breaking changes when new elements are added in the current API version.<br /><br />Forward compatibility changes will be noted here in future releases. There are currently no forward compatibility changes for this object.|[KeyValuePairOfstringstring](keyvaluepairofstringstring.md) array|
|<a name="id"></a>Id|The system generated identifier of the ad group.<br/><br/>**Add:** Not allowed.<br/>**Update:** Read-only and Required|**long**|
|<a name="language"></a>Language|Your ad language setting determines the language you will use when you write your ads and should be the language of your customers.<br/><br/>For possible values, see the Language column of [Ad Languages](../guides/ad-languages.md#adlanguage).<br/><br/> For ad groups in Dynamic Search Ads campaigns, only *English* is supported.<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT:** Support for multiple languages at the campaign level is in pilot. If languages are set at both the ad group and campaign level, the ad group-level language will override the campaign-level language. The customer is enabled for the pilot if the [GetCustomerPilotFeatures](../customer-management-service/getcustomerpilotfeatures.md) response includes pilot number *310*. Pilot participants will be able to set multiple languages at the campaign level, and during update will be able to delete the ad group level language by specifying an empty string value (*""*). If you leave this element nil, then the ad group language will not be updated. If your application depends on ad group language being set, then you must prepare for the possibility that ad group language will be nil.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional if the campaign has one or more languages set, and otherwise language is required.<br/>**Update:** Optional if the customer is in the *Campaign Languages* pilot, and otherwise update is not allowed. If you are not in the pilot and try to change the language during update, an error will be returned.|**string**|
|<a name="name"></a>Name|The name of the ad group.<br/><br/>The name must be unique among all active ad groups within the campaign. The name can contain a maximum of 256 characters.<br/><br/>**Add:** Required<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|**string**|
|<a name="nativebidadjustment"></a>NativeBidAdjustment|The percent amount by which to adjust your bid for intent ads above or below the base ad group or keyword bid.<br/><br/> Not everyone has this feature yet. If you don't, don't worry. It's coming soon.<br /><br />Supported values are negative one hundred (-100) through positive nine hundred (900). Setting the bid adjustment to -100 percent will prevent intent ads from showing for this ad group.<br /><br />Set this element to zero (0) if you do not want any bid adjustment for intent ads. If this element is null you will inherit the *NativeBidAdjustment* setting of the ad group's [Campaign](campaign.md).<br /><br />**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. This property will only be updated if you also set the *UpdateNativeBidAdjustment* element of the [UpdateAdGroups](updateadgroups.md) request message to *true*, and otherwise this property will be ignored. If the ad group already has a native bid adjustment, and you want to remove it to effectively inherit the *NativeBidAdjustment* setting of the ad group's [Campaign](campaign.md), set this element to null.|**int**|
|<a name="network"></a>Network|The search networks where you want your ads to display.<br /><br />Possible values are *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*, *OwnedAndOperatedOnly*, and *SyndicatedSearchOnly*. <br /><br />If you select one of the syndicated search options, you can call the [SetNegativeSitesToAdGroups](setnegativesitestoadgroups.md) or [SetNegativeSitesToCampaigns](setnegativesitestocampaigns.md) operation to prevent the ads from displaying on specific syndicated search websites.<br/><br/>For more information about networks and ad distribution, see the [About Ad Distribution](http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50871/0) help article.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The default is *OwnedAndOperatedAndSyndicatedSearch*.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[Network](network.md)|

|<a name="remarketingtargetingsetting"></a>RemarketingTargetingSetting|The targeting setting that is applicable for all audiences e.g., custom audiences and remarketing lists that are associated with this ad group. Each audience can be associated with multiple ad groups, and each ad group's remarketing targeting setting is applied independently for delivery.<br/><br/>Possible values are *TargetAndBid* and *BidOnly*. <br/><br/>Set this element to *TargetAndBid* if you want to show ads only to people included in the audience, with the option to change the bid amount. Ads in this ad group will only show to people included in the audience.<br/><br/>Set this element to *BidOnly* if you want to show ads to people searching for your ad, with the option to change the bid amount for people included in the audience. Ads in this ad group can show to everyone but the bid adjustment will apply to people included in the audience.<br /><br /> This element is not returned in the *AdGroup* object by default. You must include *RemarketingTargetingSetting* in the optional *ReturnAdditionalFields* flags when calling [GetAdGroupsByCampaignId](getadgroupsbycampaignid.md) and [GetAdGroupsByIds](getadgroupsbyids.md).<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. The default value is *BidOnly*.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[RemarketingTargetingSetting](remarketingtargetingsetting.md)|
|<a name="settings"></a>Settings|The ad group settings for criterion type group targets.<br /><br />The target setting determines whether the Age, Audience, CompanyName, Gender, Industry, and JobFunction criterions associated with this ad group use the "target and bid" option or the "bid only" target option.<br /><br />The contract specifies a list; however, currently a maximum of one [TargetSetting](targetsetting.md) object is supported. Within the [TargetSetting](targetsetting.md) you can have multiple [TargetSettingDetail](targetsettingdetail.md) objects i.e., one per [CriterionTypeGroup](criteriontypegroup.md).<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If this element is nil, the default bid option for all criterion type groups is effectively "bid only".<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[Setting](setting.md) array|
|<a name="startdate"></a>StartDate|The date that the ads in the ad group can begin serving; otherwise, the service can begin serving the ads in the ad group the day that the ad group becomes active.<br /><br />The start date cannot be updated after the ad group is submitted.<br /><br />The start date is inclusive. For example, if you set *StartDate* to 11/5/2016, the ads in the ad group will start at 12:00 AM on 11/5/2016. The time is based on the time zone that you specify at the campaign level.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional. If you do not set the start date, then it will default to today's date and the service can begin serving the ads in the ad group as soon as the ad group status is active.<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|[Date](date.md)|
|<a name="status"></a>Status|The status of the ad group.<br/><br/>Possible values are *Active*, *Expired*, and *Paused*. The *Expired* status is read-only.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional.

|<a name="trackingurltemplate"></a>TrackingUrlTemplate|The tracking template to use as a default for all URLs in your ad group.<br /><br />The following validation rules apply to tracking templates. For more details about supported templates and parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2)- Tracking templates defined for lower level entities e.g. ads override those set for higher level entities e.g. campaign. For more information, see [Entity Hierarchy and Limits](../guides/entity-hierarchy-limits.md).- The length of the tracking template is limited to 2,048 characters. The HTTP or HTTPS protocol string does count towards the 2,048 character limit.- The tracking template must be a well-formed URL beginning with one of the following: *http://*, *https://*, *{lpurl}*, or *{unescapedlpurl}*. - Bing Ads does not validate whether custom parameters exist. If you use custom parameters in your tracking template and they do not exist, then the landing page URL will include the key and value placeholders of your custom parameters without substitution. For example if your tracking template is for example *http://tracker.example.com/?season={_season}&promocode={_promocode}&u={lpurl}*, and neither *{_season}* or *{_promocode}* are defined at the campaign, ad group, criterion, keyword, or ad level, then the landing page URL will be the same.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed.|**string**|
|<a name="urlcustomparameters"></a>UrlCustomParameters|Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.<br /><br />You may include up to 3 individual [CustomParameter](customparameter.md) objects within the [CustomParameters](customparameters.md) object. Each [CustomParameter](customparameter.md) contains a *Key* and *Value* element.<br /><br />**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set the *Parameters* element of the [CustomParameters](customparameters.md) object to null or empty. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep in the *Parameters* element of the [CustomParameters](customparameters.md) object.|[CustomParameters](customparameters.md)|
