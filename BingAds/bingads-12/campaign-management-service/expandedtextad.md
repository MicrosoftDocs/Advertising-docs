# ExpandedTextAd Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines an expanded text ad.

This ad format works seamlessly on mobile, tablet and desktop devices so you can focus more on crafting your longer ad copy and optimizing your ad text to better engage your customers before they click your ad.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use expanded text ads, you must upgrade to Final Urls. For more information, see [URL Tracking with Upgraded URLs](../guides/url-tracking-upgraded-urls.md).

## <a name="elements"></a>Elements

|Element|Description|Data Type|
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
|<a name="displayurl"></a>DisplayUrl|The URL that will be displayed instead of the final URL. The final URL will still be used for the landing page URL.<br/><br/>Reserved for limited pilot usage e.g. pharmaceutical customers.<br/><br/>The domain portion of the URL in combination with the path 1 and path 2 strings cannot exceed 67 characters.|**string**|
|<a name="path1"></a>Path1|The first part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *http://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL (*FinalUrls* element).  Then if you have specified a value for *Path1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path1*. For example if your *FinalUrls* contains *http://www.contoso.com*, *Path1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *http://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.<br/><br/>The path can contain a countdown function. For more details see [Countdown Functions](../guides/expanded-text-ads.md#countdown).<br /><br />The path can contain dynamic parameters such as {MatchType}. For a list of supported parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).<br /><br />The maximum input length of the path is 50 characters with dynamic text strings. However, the ad will fail to display if the path exceeds 15 characters after dynamic text substitution occurs. Note that for languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the path is 25 characters, and the path is limited to 7 characters after substitution.<br/><br/>The double-width characters are determined by the characters you use instead of the character set of the campaign or ad group language settings. Double-width characters include Korean, Japanese and Chinese languages characters as well as Emojis.<br /><br />The path cannot contain the forward slash (/) or newline (\n) characters.<br /><br />If the path includes a space, it will be replaced with an underscore (_) when the ad is shown.<br/><br/>**Add:** Optional<br/>**Update:** Optional|**string**|
|<a name="path2"></a>Path2|The second part of the optional path that will be appended to the domain portion of your display URL. The domain portion of your display URL e.g. *http://www.contoso.com* will be generated from the domain of your Final URL (*FinalUrls* element).  Then if you have specified a value for *Path1* it will be appended to the display URL. If you have also specified a value for *Path2*, then it will also be appended to the display URL after *Path1*. For example if your *FinalUrls* contains *http://www.contoso.com*, *Path1* is set to *subdirectory1*, and *Path2* is set to *subdirectory2*, then the URL displayed will be *http://www.contoso.com/subdirectory1/subdirectory2*.<br /><br />You can only specify *Path2* if *Path1* is also set.<br/><br/>The path can contain a countdown function. For more details see [Countdown Functions](../guides/expanded-text-ads.md#countdown).<br /><br />The path can contain dynamic parameters such as {MatchType}. For a list of supported parameters, see the Bing Ads help article [What tracking or URL parameters can I use?](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56799/2).<br /><br />The maximum input length of the path is 50 characters with dynamic text strings.

|<a name="text"></a>Text|The ad copy.<br /><br />The text must contain at least one word. <br/><br/>The text can contain a countdown function.

However, the ad will fail to display if the copy exceeds 80 characters after dynamic text substitution occurs. Note that for languages with double-width characters e.g. Traditional Chinese the maximum input length of the copy is 150 characters, and the text is limited to 40 characters after substitution.<br/><br/>The double-width characters are determined by the characters you use instead of the character set of the campaign or ad group language settings.
