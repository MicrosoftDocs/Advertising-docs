# Text Ad
Defines a text ad that can be downloaded and uploaded in a bulk file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Standard Text Ads have been deprecated in favor of Expanded Text Ads (EXTAs). Support for adding and updating standard text ads (STAs) ended on July 31, 2017. Now, advertisers can get and delete, but can no longer add new STAs or update existing standard text ads with Destination URLs. One exception to the rule, is that you can still update the STA status e.g. from *Active* to *Paused*. Otherwise attempts to add or update STAs will result in the *CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid* error. 
> 
> It is important to note that all your existing STAs will continue to serve alongside EXTAs for the foreseeable future. While there is no date on when STAs will stop serving, you can expect an update to all of our customers well in advance once we make the decision to sunset serving STAs.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For a *Text Ad* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](../bulk/bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Format Preference](#adformatpreference)
- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Custom Parameter](#customparameter)
- [Device Preference](#devicepreference)
- [Display Url](#displayurl)
- [Editorial Appeal Status](#editorialappealstatus)
- [Editorial Location](#editoriallocation)
- [Editorial Reason Code](#editorialreasoncode)
- [Editorial Status](#editorialstatus)
- [Editorial Term](#editorialterm)
- [Final Url](#finalurl)
- [Id](#id)
- [Mobile Final Url](#mobilefinalurl)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Publisher Countries](#publishercountries)
- [Status](#status)
- [Text](#text)
- [Title](#title)
- [Tracking Template](#trackingtemplate)

You can download all fields of the *Text Ad* record by including the [DownloadEntity](../bulk/downloadentity.md) value of *TextAds* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](../bulk/downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](../bulk/downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](../bulk/datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](~/guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new text ad given a valid ad group ID (*Parent Id*). 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Title,Text,Display Url,Destination Url,Promotion,Device Preference,Ad Format Preference,Name,App Platform,App Id,Final Url,Mobile Final Url,Tracking Template,Custom Parameter,Title Part 1,Title Part 2,Path 1,Path 2
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,
Text Ad,Active,,-1111,ParentCampaignNameGoesHere,AdGroupNameHere,ClientIdGoesHere,,Contoso Quick Setup,Find New Customers & Increase Sales!,contoso.com,,,All,False,,,,http://www.contoso.com/womenshoesale,http://mobile.contoso.com/womenshoesale,,{_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](~/guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkTextAd* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 


```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkTextAd
var bulkTextAd = new BulkTextAd

                },

    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

### <a name="adformatpreference"></a>Ad Format Preference
The *Ad Format Preference* field is used to indicate whether or not you prefer the ad copy to be shown to users as a search or native ad. Search ads tend to be written as a call to action, whereas native ads should be written in more of an informational style. By defining at least one ad that should be used as native, the search ads will only be shown in search results.

**Important:** You must define at least one text ad per ad group that is not native preferred, otherwise the ad copy of all text ads will be eligible for both search and native ads.

Possible values are *Native* and *All*. If set to *All*, the ad will be eligible for both search and native ad formats. If set to *Native*, the ad will only be eligible for the native ad format.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field when creating a text ad, by default the ad format preference will be set to *All*.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. If you set this field to *delete_value* when updating a text ad, the ad format preference will be set to the default value i.e. *All*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="adgroup"></a>Ad Group
The name of the ad group that contains the ad.

**Add:** Read-only and Required  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

> [!NOTE]
> For add, update, and delete, you must specify either the *Parent Id* or *Ad Group* field.

### <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the ad group and ad.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="customparameter"></a>Custom Parameter
Your custom collection of key and value parameters for URL tracking.

In a bulk file, the list of custom parameters are formatted as follows.

-   Format each custom parameter pair as Key=Value, for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1.

-   You may include up to 3 custom parameter key and value pairs. Each key and value pair are delimited by a semicolon and space ("; "), for example {_promoCode}=PROMO1; {_season}=summer.

-   A Key cannot contain a semicolon. If a Value contains a semicolon it must be escaped as '\;'. Additionally if the Value contains a backslash it must also be escaped as '\\'.

-   The Key must be formatted with surrounding braces and a leading underscore, for example if the Key is promoCode, it must be formatted as {_promoCode}.

    **Note:** With the Bulk service the surrounding braces and underscore are required. The maximum length of 16 UTF-8 bytes does not include the braces and underscore: '{', '_', and '}'. With the Campaign Management service the maximum length is 16 UTF-bytes, and you may not specify the surrounding braces and underscore.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. To remove all custom parameters, set this field to *delete_value*. The *delete_value* keyword removes the previous setting. To remove a subset of custom parameters, specify the custom parameters that you want to keep and omit any that you do not want to keep. The new set of custom parameters will replace any previous custom parameter set.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="devicepreference"></a>Device Preference
This field determines whether the preference is for text ads to be displayed on all devices or only on mobile devices. 

Possible values are *All* and *Mobile*, which differ from values used in the campaign management service. 

The default value is *All*.

In the bulk download and upload results file, this field will never be empty. If you did not specify a device preference, the default value of *All* will be returned.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must define at least one text ad per ad group that is not mobile preferred, otherwise the ad copy of all text ads will be eligible for all devices.

**Add:** Optional. If you do not set this field when creating a text ad, by default the device preference will be set to *All*.  
**Update:** Optional. If no value is specified on update, this Bing Ads setting is not changed. If you set this field to *delete_value*, then you are effectively resetting to the default value of *All*.    
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="displayurl"></a>Display Url

## <a name="entityperformancedata"></a>Performance Data Fields in the Bulk File
If the [DataScope Value Set](../bulk/datascope.md) element of the download request includes *EntityPerformanceData*, the download file will also include the following fields in this record.

|Column Header|Description|
|-----------------|---------------|
|*Spend*|The cost per click (CPC) summed for each click.|
|*Impressions*|The number of times an ad has been displayed on search results pages. Without impressions there are no clicks or conversions.|
|*Clicks*|The number of times that the ads in the account were clicked.|
|*CTR*|The click-through rate (CTR) is the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions). For example, if your ads got 50 clicks given 2,348 impressions, your CTR is 2.13 (%).

The formula for calculating CTR is *(Clicks / Impressions) * 100*.|
|*Avg CPC*|The average cost per click (CPC). The total cost of all clicks on an ad divided by the number of clicks. This is the average amount you're actually charged each time your ad is clicked. For example, if you paid a total of 48.35 for 300 clicks, your average CPC is 0.16.

The formula for calculating the average CPC is *(Spend /Clicks)*.|
|*Avg CPM*|The average of the cost-per-thousand impressions of the ads.

The value will be 0 (zero) if the corresponding ad groups do not specify the Content ad distribution medium.|
|*Avg position*|The average position of the ad on a webpage.|
|*Conversions*|The number of conversions. A conversion is the completion of an action by a customer after viewing your ad. The action could be purchasing your product, registering for your webinar, joining an organization, or whatever you consider your goal and best measure of the ad's success.|
|*CPA*|The cost per conversion. The formula for calculating the cost per conversion is *(Spend / Conversions)*.

Only ads in campaigns that enable conversion tracking contribute to the conversion number, so unless all campaigns in the account enable conversion tracking, the number will not be accurate.|
