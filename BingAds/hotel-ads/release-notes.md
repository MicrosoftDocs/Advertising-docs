## October 15, 2017

Released the Beta version of Hotel Ads.

### Nonbreaking changes

- Added the following ways to send Bing your transaction messages.  
  - Pull requests  
  If you sign up for pull requests, Bing sends the endpoint that you specify a [Query](../query-message/query-message.md) message that specifies the itinerary data that you should send back in a [Transaction](../transaction-message/transaction-message.md) message. With this option, you provide Bing all of your itinerary data.  
  - Pull with hints requests  
  If you sign up for pull with hints requests, Bing sends the endpoint that you specify a Query message that specifies the itinerary data that you should send back in a Transaction message. However, the query message specifies only the itinerary data that you said changed in your [Hint](../hint-message/hint-message.md) message. 
  
- Added the following messages to support the two types of pull requests.  
  - [QueryControl](../query-control-message/query-control-message.md) message  
  - [Hint](../hint-message/hint-message.md) message
  - [Query](../query-message/query-message.md) message  
  
- Increased the number of days prior to check in that users can book (advanced booking window) from 90 days to 180 days.
