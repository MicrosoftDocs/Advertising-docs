# CustomAudience Data Object - Campaign Management
Defines a custom audience. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only update of the [Name](#name) and [Description](#description) are supported. You can delete but cannot add a custom audience using the Bing Ads API. Having said that, you can add and delete custom audience associations and exclusions.

A custom audience is a type of remarketing list that is generated by using your own customer data to create richer user segments. You can use custom audiences in conjunction with your remarketing lists, usually through your data management provider (DMP). When your DMP connects to our custom audience feature, you can then import your custom audiences into Bing Ads for search remarketing. You can use custom audiences separately from remarketing, with no UET required.

> [!TIP]
> For an overview of custom audiences see the [About custom audiences](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56849/-1) help topic.
